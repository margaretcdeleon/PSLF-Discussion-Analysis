Reddit,PSLF,student loan forgiveness,1n0yjzp,Buyback: do pre-loan or one-time IDR adjustment months qualify?,"I don't think I've seen this question addressed here before--I am hoping to apply for buyback in 01/2027. If being on SAVE hadn't put me into forbearance, I would have hit 120 payments in 12/2026. However, I realized that my payment count includes 4 months from the IDR account adjustment a couple of years ago, right before I started working full time for a qualifying employer. I do have 4 months of other non-profit full time employment, but it took place before I took out my student loans (employment in 2009, took out first loan in 2010). 

Will either the account adjustment months or the pre-loan months be allowed to count for buyback, or will I have to wait an additional 4 months before applying?

And, side question--anyone feel strongly about the plan to wait for buyback vs switch to IBR now? I feel like I'm right in the grey area (90 payments made pre-forced forbearance) where neither choice is clearly better than the other.  I don't plan to leave my job as soon as I have forgiveness, but for peace of mind alone I'm super eager to be done with this whole process.

Reddit,PSLF,student loan forgiveness,1n0y1ln,PSLF - Reaching 120 Payments in Oct 2025 (But Employer Mistake May Delay It),"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice. According to the StudentAid website, I’m set to reach my 120 qualifying payments for PSLF in **October 2025**. However, I recently discovered that my employer mistakenly certified **two months during my training period** when I wasn’t actually a full-time employee yet. Those months shouldn’t count toward PSLF.

I’ve already submitted a reconsideration request to have those two months removed, which would push my official 120th payment to **December 2025**. But it’s been **weeks with no update** on the reconsideration.

So now I’m wondering:

* Should I **go ahead and file for forgiveness in October 2025** anyway, and just continue making payments until I hear back?
* Or should I **wait until December** when I’ll definitely have the full 120 legitimate payments (even if those two months end up getting excluded)?

Reddit,PSLF,student loan forgiveness,1n0pfcn,Help figuring out status on Mohela.,"EDIT - all figured out. Thanks to those who responded. 

Hi all! My apologies as this may be a dumb question…I’m new to this sub I feel like I don’t understand all the terminology. 

I hit 120 payments on my loan back in June 2025. On studentaid.gov, seeing what I assume are the “green banners” with the message “congratulations! You have satisfied your obligation, and no additional payments are required for this loan.” 

So far, I haven’t gotten any confirmation from Mohela or dept of ed that the loan was officially forgiven. Just that I completed my payments. 

My question is, on Mohela, I still have my auto pay set up. It shows that my usual amount is scheduled to be withdrawn (obviously) but it says my amount due is $0. I can’t remember what it was like before I completed my payments - does it just say amount due is $0 because I have autopay set up?? If I cancel autopay, will it start to show my usual amount due? 

Tried calling Mohela but gave up after struggling to get a human on the phone despite selecting many different # options. Any time you select something about PSLF their messaging tells you to go directly to the department of ed. So if anyone has tips on how they successfully got deferment as they waited for official forgiveness, I would welcome the advice!

False. 2/8 loans are still stuck in SAVE despite the ICR letter claiming the loans were not. 

Yet, On both the MOHELA website and the federal student loans website, those two loans despite the verification letter, RN,SAV forbearance with no payment due.
Talk to an advanced agent a month ago (after being on hold for 4 hours) , and she claimed she  submitted paperwork claiming it would be fixed. She acknowledged it was an error because  of automated processing (meaning AI processed the application— whoops! Not a human), and that all the loans should be under the ICR plan.

After 10 business days, here we are 20 days later.

The advance agent told me that, despite the fact that the two other loans were in SAVE forbearance, with the paperwork, she is submitting, it would count towards my PSL left alone, and all would be caught up by the next payment.

Shocker? It did not. I was happily ready to pay my last payment for PSLF for all of the loans.  and now I’m beating my head against the wall because two of the loans claim that there is no payment due and there’s still stuck.

Yesterday I received an email from a MOHELA Ombudsman Specialist stating that my IBR application was approved on August 12, and that my account would remain on a processing forbearance until September 1. The email stated that “the effective date is October 1.” 

My due date is the 1st of each month. I haven’t received a system generated IBR “approval” letter - just the generic IDR notice of repayment change letter. I’m still on the SAVE plan. My next due date is November 1. 

I am pursuing PSLF. What should I do about the October 1 due date? Will it qualify for PSLF? I am concerned that if I request that my processing forbearance or natural disaster forbearance be extended to cover my October 1 due date, the IBR plan will not be successfully applied to my account. 

As we all know, MOHELA‘s system is quite wonky. This happened to me once before - MOHELA claimed that it approved a wet signed IBR application on April 29, 2025, and put me into a processing forbearance until June 1, 2025.

Hello,

I’m one of the PSLF applicants currently in SAVE forbearance. Recently, I received a notification on my Federal Student Aid account stating that I need to recertify. If I do, I’ll have to switch to IBR (with an estimated $45 monthly payment), which would put me back into repayment. I am nowhere near the forgiveness payment count so I was using this time to sort some other things out. 

I called the federal customer service line to confirm, and while the representative agreed, the call disconnected mid-sentence. Frustrated, I hung up. I had originally contacted my servicer (MOHELA), and they told me I don’t need to recertify or switch plans until November 2026. I’m also fairly certain I already submitted a recertification application that wasn’t processed right away because of the system delays.

To make things more confusing, the first MOHELA representative I spoke with said I owed a $29 payment—even though both my online MOHELA account and their automated system show that I currently owe $0. The second ""specialized"" agent she transferred me too also confirmed that I don’t owe anything.

Adding to the confusion, I haven’t received any emails or letters about recertification or payments. At this point, I’m unsure what steps I should take. I think the last official communication is have received was over 2 months ago about interest starting to accumulate again.

I am copying/pasting my most recent correspondence exchange with MOHELA. Get a load of this mess…

I contacted them because of the forbearance they put me in (that I didn’t ask for) and the two qualifying payments I’m not getting credit for—initially just March because they claimed I was in already the forbearance when my payment was AUTO DRAFTED from my account, and then retroactive February for the supposed same reason (but they didn’t have any problems taking my automatic draft payments that SHOULDN’T have processed if I was actually under forbearance at the time). 

Here is the copy/paste of the message I sent them:

Original message:

Hello.

Back in March, AFTER making my monthly payment, I was placed in a forbearance (presumably because of the SAVE business, except that I was never on SAVE and there was some runaround hangup on recertifying my income that apparently didn’t need to happen). After two months of back and forth and runaround with MOHELA, I finally got the forbearance lifted and payments resumed.

Prior to this forbearance mess, my March payment was showing as qualifying, but needing employment certification on the StudentAid.gov website. I periodically check my accounts, and I have noticed that it is now showing as ineligible, citing that I was in forbearance on my due date. As I have always had automatic drafts done for my payments, if I was in forbearance on that date, my payment would not have drafted. Is there any way I can get this payment back to qualifying, as it should have been? (Especially since I was never in SAVE and should not have been placed in that forbearance, to begin with). I already lost the months of April and May of this year to be able to make payments because it took that long and going through a LOT of different departments with MOHELA to get it fixed to where I was no longer on the forbearance. Since that mess already set me behind by two months (when it should not have), I don’t want to lose March on top of it, as I made that payment (auto-drafted and unaware of the road MOHELA was about to send me down). It feels like folks are being punished every step of the way while trying to follow the rules of this program (if you don’t believe me, go check out the subreddit PSLF…it’s very depressing).

Also, I noticed that my July payment, which came out on the 20th (two and a half weeks ago) is not yet showing up on my StudentAid.gov account. Is this also an oversight and the info has not been shared with them, yet? I know it took a while for my June payment to show up on their website, but I don’t recall it taking this long.

Thanks for any insight you can give!

Reddit,PSLF,"""Public Service Loan Forgiveness""",1mupb70,"Green Banners, But Confusing Timeline","The day after the election in 2024 I submitted a switch to IBR as I had been stuck at 118/120 payments. I submitted an ECF in February, which pushed me to 119 with the processing forbearance, leaving me with a final payment in March. Right before I made the payment, I submitted another ECF to see if I could avoid making it if I was in processing forbearance as of March 1st. I unfortunately checked the 'put me in forbearance' box. The form was processed, but March wasn't shown as eligible (likely general forbearance). The March payment was withdrawn from Mohela and I submitted the final ECF on April 1st. After the final ECF was processed, it listed the March payment is ineligible due to forbearance. However, I wasn't in forbearance when the payment was withdrawn.

I received notification of a change from studentaid on 5/15, which showed March as ineligible. I then submitted a Reconsideration request on 5/15, which was denied pretty quickly (6/5), stating that the payment was ineligible. Realizing that my forbearance might have been backdated, I called Mohela and a rep showed no forbearance when the payment was withdrawn. At this point I realized my only course of action was to request to go off forbearance and make another payment, then submit another ECF. The Mohela rep stated that it will be 90 days. I check both studentaid and Mohela every so often, but it became more irregular as time passed as I was feeling that forgiveness was going to take much longer than I had hoped. Then on 7/15 I happened to check studentaid and I see that I have green banners, but I still have not received email notification of this change, so I don't know when it occurred.

I later received an email on 8/11 that is a response to my buyback request from sometime in 2024 and it states:

""Thank you for submitting a Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF) Reconsideration request.  We have completed your PSLF buyback assessment.

This experience seems different from the many threads I've read on this subreddit. I'm not sure what prompted the March payment counting after it was reviewed twice, but I'll take it.

I submitted an ECF in February, which pushed me to 119 with the processing forbearance, leaving me with a final payment in March. Right before I made the payment, I submitted another ECF to see if I could avoid making it if I was in processing forbearance as of March 1st. I unfortunately checked the 'put me in forbearance' box. The form was processed, but March wasn't shown as eligible (likely general forbearance). The March payment was withdrawn from Mohela and I submitted the final ECF on April 1st. After the final ECF was processed, it listed the March payment is ineligible due to forbearance. However, I wasn't in forbearance when the payment was withdrawn.

Why We Are Contacting You

During the week of July 21, 2025, we received a duplicate payment file from [Pay.gov](http://Pay.gov), the

platform that sends payment information to us for federal student loan payments. This action

resulted in an extra payment being reflected on your federal student loan account. However, no

extra payment was withdrawn from your bank account.

The duplicate payment reflected on your federal student loan has been removed and a new bill

was generated. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

If You Are Participating in Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)

In order for a payment to be considered a qualifying monthly payment for Public Service Loan

Forgiveness (PSLF), it needs to be a full payment, be made on time, and under a qualifying

repayment plan, while you are employed full-time by a qualifying employer. Be sure to refer to

your updated billing statement and amount due.

Actions You Need to Take to Determine Your Next Payment Due

· Log in to view your updated account information.

· Select “Inbox” from the menu, and then select the “Documents we sent to you” tab.

· Open the most recent message with the subject “Your Monthly Billing Statement.” The inbox

is sorted with your newest message at the top.

· Review your most recent billing statement to ensure the next payment amount you make

is correct to cover the amount due.

Good afternoon,

The Department is aware of an issue affecting PSLF payment counts from August 2024 to present. 

System updates have been implemented to correctly report PSLF eligible payments on a go-forward basis. However, remediation activities are in progress to report prior months and update PSLF payment counts. 

Affected borrowers will not see updated PSLF payment counts for these missing months until September 2025.    

In October, if your constituent does not see the PSLF payment counts they are expecting, then they are encouraged to [submit a reconsideration request](https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&amp;cid=SenDuckworth&amp;crop=17827QQQ29300511QQQ14371382QQQ10867012&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fstudentaid.gov%2fmanage-loans%2fpslf-reconsideration&amp;redir_log=104101199705401). 

Please note that submitting duplicate requests through various channels will not update payment counts any sooner and may cause additional delays. This includes sending multiple inquiries through reconsideration requests, complaints with FDMS (Ombudsman), controlled correspondence (letters), and PSLF buyback requests.

 Best,

You may follow up with our office if the portal is not updated in October.

Life started happening around step 1 taking time. I had to move the date several time (like 3+) because of reasons I couldn't control. Car trouble, site technical issues, no money to get to site, family drama, etc. Anyway I ended up failing bc every time I pushed back I didn't realize it would happen and progressively studied less and less and lost a lot of the information to time.

Fast forward to now and my school has a policy that won't let me enroll in the next semester until I sit for step 1 again. The issue is that means no loan, which means no money for me. I've been studying and trying my hardest, but I've run out of money (bc I was expecting a loan refund at this point) and I have several overdue bills and my bank account is overdrawn by several hundred dollars. I think my car is at risk of getting repo'd and though I made rent I still owe a $10 late fee which I literally can't afford, putting me at risk of eviction.

I'm a non-trad student who didn't have the best past. My credit is absolute dog crap so every personal loan I apply for I get denied for credit history, and the ones that don't care about that want me to have a job which I had to quit to keep up with medical school.

I can't even afford to sign up for another step 1 date. I've been studying and think I might be ready, but the price is way to steep for me right now. Its a cyclical problem. I can't get money until I take step and I can't take step without money.

I'm at my witt's end right now. I don't have family or personal support. Despite being told to contact student support and tutoring services, they ignore my emails.

I can't even afford to sign up for another step 1 date. I've been studying and think I might be ready, but the price is way to steep for me right now. Its a cyclical problem. I can't get money until I take step and I can't take step without money.

I'm at my witt's end right now. I don't have family or personal support. Despite being told to contact student support and tutoring services, they ignore my emails. Like legit I've been told by one of them after I fought my way to get a meeting with her, ""Yeah I saw your email, but I didn't think it was that serious so I didn't respond. Sorry.""

I don't know what to do, I really don't expect stranger to have to solution but I needed to get this off my chest. If you do have any advice or solutions I would gladly take it.",,,,

Reddit,medicalschool,student loan forgiveness,1mm7k17,Residency Applicants Be(a)ware - University of Washington (UW),"For anyone who is interested in going to UW for residency I would encourage you to look elsewhere unless you have/come from $$$$. I think it's important for people to know that the residents are currently working without a contract (it expired in June) and UW is essentially bargaining in bad faith with the resident union. They made their ""last, best, and final offer"" of the bargaining sessions last week. They are offering a raise of 4% in the first year, 3% in the second year, and 3% in the third year of the contract, which is welllll below market value for west coast residents, especially in high cost cities (but higher than their initial offer of 1%). It's even more insulting because UW is increasing costs on residents by 4% - 4.5% for things they need to work (parking), so theyre not even keeping up with their own rates of inflation. They also dont get the same benefits most other employees get (like access to the UW gym).

UW residents dont make enough money to pay for rent and food in Seattle and live comfortably and most that I know are working second jobs on the side just to subsist on top of the 80 hour work weeks. The ones I know who aren't working another job are pulling from savings or relying on partners just to live in Seattle and this is before the student loan payments increase under the new bill.

I feel it's important to have some background here so people are aware of what the real costs are. Over the last contract cycle (the past three years) the residents increased their salary by 3% each year. At the time the union basically agreed to a ""pay cut"" because UW claimed the pandemic was costing them too much money, with the promise they would make more with this new contract. Over the past 3 years the cost of living in Seattle has gone up 28% so UW residents are already underwater.

~~Over the next three years Seattle is projecting an inflation rate around 40% so the contract offer for the residents will put them waaaay behind the adjusted cost of living in the area~~. Edit: looks like Seattle updated their projections and it’s much better than a few weeks ago, Seattle is still expensive, but it’s not gonna be absurd hopefully. Link is in the comments, looks like they update their forecast every two months if people want to keep an eye out. PGY1/2 at UW already make less than the median area income and PGY 1 and 2 are considered ""low income"", but make too much to qualify for any of the benefits if they were a little more poor.

UW has claimed they dont take into account the cost of living in anyones negotiations, but are currently offering the nurses much higher raises. (also, who knew there were nursing residents??? - they start at over $100,000 at UW to work 36 hours a week, insane). They are claiming the Big Beautiful Bill is going to hurt them soooo much they cant afford to pay residents more.

That being said...you will get good training at UW and they are ranked in the top of basically every specialty for a reason.

**TLDR:** UW doesnt pay residents enough money to live in Seattle without residents working a side gig or living far away and are unwilling to negotiate reasonable raises. Dont rank UW without having money to pay your way or without realizing you might need to dip into savings/work another job to live in Seattle.

Reddit,medicalschool,PSLF,1lqzl3r,"For current or upcoming graduates, is the bill bad?","From what I understand:

* Bill creates a repayment plan similiar to SAVE where your monthly payment is capped at X% of your income (most likely 10%)
* If the minimum payment doesn't cover your montly interest and/or loan balance, the government covers both the interest and unpaid capital. In addition the governement provides a $10-25 payment match a month. 

Effects:

Reddit,medicalschool,PSLF,1lg9bmk,Please help me understand how Trump's Bill impacts medical loans.,"Hi all,

I’m trying to plan my financial future, and the federal government seems determined to make that as stressful as possible. I’d really appreciate help understanding how the proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill” might impact student loans for current medical students.

For context, I’m a rising M2.

From what I understand, all loans **disbursed after July 1, 2026** would fall under the new rules — including a **$150,000 borrowing cap** and the **loss of PSLF eligibility**. Even if the loan was authorized or the promissory note signed earlier, what matters is the **disbursement date**. That would mean my **M3 and M4 loans would be subject to the new restrictions**.

However, I came across the “application of prior limits” clause, which states:

&gt;

This makes me unsure:

* **Does this mean current students like me will be exempt from the new borrowing limits entirely?**
* Or should I still try to take out as much in federal loans as possible before July 1, 2026, to preserve PSLF eligibility?

Any clarification would be greatly appreciated as I try to make informed borrowing decisions",1750439264.0,2025-06-20 10:07:44,/r/medicalschool/comments/1lg9bmk/please_help_me_understand_how_trumps_bill_impacts/,Trippanzee,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lg9bmk/please_help_me_understand_how_trumps_bill_impacts/,24.0,0.88,5.0,False,self.medicalschool,True,"Please help me understand how Trump's Bill impacts medical loans.

Reddit,medicalschool,PSLF,1lb9czw,Senate HELP Committee Loan Proposals Will Harm Med School Students- Write Your Senators,"[From the CRFB](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-help-committee-proposes-355-billion-offsets)\- Jun. 11, 2025, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee released its part of the Senate reconciliation package, which estimates a savings of roughly **$355 billion** between fiscal year (FY) 2025 and 2034. These savings come from eliminating and limiting loans for graduate-level studies such as medical school.

&gt;They “estimate an additional $50 billion of savings from eliminating graduate PLUS loans and limiting borrowing in other loans. Specifically, the package limits graduate borrowing to $20,500 annually and $100,000 total for master’s students and $50,000 annually and $200,000 total for professional students (such as lawyers, doctors, or dentists). This differs from the House, which had $150,000 aggregate caps for professional students, and annual limits in the House bill were set at the program level.

&gt;The Senate also sets an aggregate cap on the amounts parents can borrow to $20,000 per year and $65,000 lifetime *per child,* whereas the House plan caps aggregate borrowing to $50,000 for all children of the parent. The Senate also leaves loan limits for undergraduates untouched (whereas the House allows for borrowing based on the typical cost of a given program of study) and does not include the House requirement that students borrow before parents. The Senate also retains Subsidized Stafford loans, which are repealed in the House for a savings of $20 billion.”

The median cost of attending medical school per the AAMC (public + living expenses) is $250,000–$300,000+. The proposed $200,000 cap leaves many students tens of thousands short. Eliminating Grad PLUS loans pushes students toward riskier private debt and those loans do not qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or income-driven repayment. It disproportionately harms first-generation students, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and students without family financial support.

Workforce shortages will worsen if students can’t afford to attend. The AAMC projects a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. Reducing access to medical education exacerbates healthcare gaps, especially in rural and underserved areas.

Their rationale for imposing borrowing caps is based on concerns that some graduate programs lead to degrees with limited earning potential, making it difficult for students to repay their loans. They also want to pressure institutions to control tuition inflation. While these are good intentions, the proposals will harm med school students and worsen the physician shortfall if modifications and carveouts aren't made.

Write your Congress members to ask for: 1. Exemptions or increased borrowing caps for medical, dental, and other high-cost programs. 2. Creation of a targeted federal supplemental loan for healthcare shortage fields. 3. Strengthening loan forgiveness programs like PSLF for graduates who serve in rural or underserved areas.

Subject: Protect Access to Federal Loans for Medical Students

Dear \[Senator/Representative LAST NAME\],

I’m writing to urge you to protect access to federal student loans for medical students like myself. While I recognize the importance of addressing the national debt, the proposal to eliminate Grad PLUS loans and cap borrowing at $200,000 for professional students will prevent many future doctors, dentists, and other critical professionals from completing their education.

The average cost of attending medical school is well over $250,000, leaving students to cover tens of thousands in gaps with private loans that don’t offer the same protections as federal programs. This proposal disproportionately harms students from low-income families, underrepresented backgrounds, and rural areas.

The U.S. is already facing significant physician shortages. Restricting access to medical education will only deepen the crisis in underserved communities.

Please consider supporting:

* Exemptions or increased borrowing caps for medical, dental, and other high-cost programs.
* Creation of a targeted federal supplemental loan for healthcare shortage fields.
* Strengthening loan forgiveness programs like PSLF for graduates who serve in rural or underserved areas.

Thank you for your leadership and consideration on this issue.

Sincerely,

Reddit,medicalschool,PSLF,1j8z7tt,"starting residency, federal loan repayment advice","hi all

starting residency this summer, next week is my last week as a student. originally planning to do IM -&gt; primary care, with the intention of pursuing a PSLF career pathway. 

I am concerned about the fidelity of PSLF. i understand that I signed a promissory note for my federal loans guaranteeing PSLF. That said, I see that the federal government is already finding ways to gut PSLF (e.g. changing eligibility requirements). I fear that the government will approach the DOE similarly to other agencies by cutting the workforce down to a point that it will take years after the current administration's rule to recoup workforce and institutional knowledge to catch up on PSLF loan forgiveness applications.

With this in mind, my question is, do I make IDR minimums in residency in order to preserve some quality of life *or* should I maximize my loan payment and cut out as much discretionary spending with the intention of paying down my loans quicker? 

  
What approaches are other incoming interns planning to take? Particularly interested in hearing from those going into careers with less earning potential.

Reddit,medicalschool,PSLF,1j1wn7x,Help Me Fight Against the End of IDR,"Hello everyone, I have written a bit of an opinion-piece that I hope to turn into a petition for current medical students and residents to voice our deep dissatisfaction with the current administration's encroachment on IDR and Federal Loans. Looking for feedback before circulating as a petition and contacting my state's attorney general. I know this is a small move, but I can't sit by and do nothing. Thanks:

The federal student loan program was created in 1965 to tackle the high cost of secondary and graduate education in the United States. In 1992, Congress approved **Income Contingent Repayment (ICR)** (20 USC 1087e), which allowed for borrowers to have their student loan payments determined by their income – no more than 20% of discretionary income – and offered loan forgiveness after 25 years of monthly payments. This is applicable to Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct Consolidation Loans, and Direct PLUS loans (taken out by professional and graduate students). At that time, the median annual cost for 4-year tuition and fees for medical school was US$6,740 and US$18,365, respectively^(1).

 In 2009, **Income Based Repayment (IBR)** became available and set monthly payments at 15% of discretionary income, defined as (Borrower’s Gross Income) – (150% of the poverty guidance relevant for the borrower) and retained loan forgiveness after 25 years of repayment. **IBR2** became law in 2010, although it was not available until 2014, through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. This law reduced the monthly payment to 10% of discretionary income and loan forgiveness after 20 years of payments. **Pay As You Earn (PAYE)** became available in 2012, and closely mirrored IBR2 with some additional stipulations and benefits. A similar plan, **Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)**, was introduced in 2015 with some additional benefits on top of PAYE. The **Save on Valuable Education (SAVE)** plan was rolled out in August, 2023. It reduced the monthly payment to 5% of discretionary income beginning in July, 2024, and included repayment timelines of 20 and 25 years for undergraduate and graduate borrowers, respectively. There are additional benefits in SAVE for low income earners and those with large families with the increased income exemption to 225%. 

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)** was introduced by the Bush administration in 2007. Although the first 10 years of the program’s rollout was fraught with issues that limited its effectiveness, fixes such as the Employer Certification Form have made this an essential program for future physicians. PSLF allows those who work full-time in public service (U.S.-based government organizations at any level, 501(c)(3) organizations, and other not-for-profit organizations) to make a total of 120 qualifying, nonconsecutive payments under an income driven repayment plan (SAVE, PAYE, IBR, ICR). 

The following is a direct line from the Master Promissory Note for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, as well as Direct PLUS Loans:

·      **Public Service Loan Forgiveness**

·      A Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is also available. Under this program, we will forgive the remaining balance due on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 payments (after October 1, 2007) on those loans under certain repayment plans while you are employed full-time by a qualifying employer. The required 120 payments do not have to be consecutive. Qualifying repayment plans include the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, the ICR Plan, and the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period.

·      **Note:** Although the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period is a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF, to receive any loan forgiveness under this program you must enter the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, and make the majority of the 120 payments under one of those plans.

In spring 2024, a federal court issued an injunction from fully implementing the SAVE plan. In July 2024, the 8^(th) circuit court of appeals blocked the SAVE plan in its entirety, placing those already in the program in interest-free forbearance. On February 18^(th), 2025, this same court upheld the injunction for the SAVE plan. The Trump administration has also blocked processing of PAYE and ICR plans as well. **At this time, the Department of Education has removed online applications to apply for federal Direct consolidation loans and income based repayment plans and are forced to pay the standardized repayment plan cost.** This is in direct conflict with the Master Promissory Note for each loan, which is signed each time a loan is taken out, and specifically states that our loans are eligible for PSLF, which requires that most payments must be completed under income driven repayment plans (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR, or ICR). 

I will use myself as an example of the seriousness of this issue. I am a rising intern, starting work in July. Interns and residents are expected to work up to 80 hours per week. Using an $80,000 per year salary for a resident (which is quite conservative) and $310,000 in unsubsidized federal loans (which were accrued over 4 years at a state school and included cost-of-living loans), my monthly payment on SAVE would be $384/month; on IBR would be $478/month; and on standard repayment plan would be $3,649/month. Under the current tax code, my take home salary would be $4,748/month in Massachusetts. These numbers will change with salary as residents move to become an attending but, under income drive repayment plans, that monthly payment will never exceed the monthly standard repayment plan. After 120 nonconsecutive payments on an income drive repayment plan, the remainder of the balance of my loans would be forgiven tax-free. This example underlines how crucial these income driven repayment plans are for residents in particular. While Massachusetts is a high cost of living state, the public and private medical school total cost of attendance in 2024 across the country was $60,000/year for in-state students and $90,000/year for private institutions, including tuition, fees, and living expenses. Thus, $310,000 in loans, including interest accrued during school, is typical. Furthermore, the salaries for residents in lower-cost of living states are generally lower as well. 

In 2024, the average annual cost of public and private medical school tuition and fees were US$53,485 and US$67,950, respectively^(3). This represents a 694.2% increase in public school costs and 270.5% increase in private school costs, while inflation over the same period is about 124% based on Consumer Price Index, using the Federal Reserve Bank inflation calculator. In 1992, physician average income was $177,400^(4). In 2024, that number was $363,000, although there has always been a wide range of salaries depending on specialty and location across the country^(5). This represents a 104.7% increase between those two timepoints. 

The 2024 physician compensation report projects a shortage of physicians in 2034 that could be as high as 124,000, including 17,800-48,000 deficit in primary care, 16,800 medical specialists, and 13,900 surgeons. The high cost of medical education is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to increasing the number of physicians. In addition, the increasing cuts to public insurance (Medicaid and Medicare) and increasing number of insurance claim denials by private insurers will continue to cut into physician salaries, particularly those in primary care. How do we expect to adequately treat an increasingly older and more complex population when we disincentivize future physicians from following this career path? How are young physicians going to be expected to pay for this massive and unexpected increase repayment burden on low salaries for 80 hours of work per week? How do we expect to support public healthcare institutions and public service if there is no more incentive as young physicians will ultimately pursue private medicine just to pay their loans?

Reddit,medicalschool,public service forgiveness,1mnhe86,Residency Program List Builder + Signal Algorithm,"Hey everyone, as some of you might have seen last week, I’ve been working on a machine learning model over the last \~4 months to help applicants automatically build a program list + strategically assign signals to maximize interviews based on factors like geo pref, MD vs DO vs IMG, Step 2, research, med school prestige + feeder programs, etc for all specialties.

You can find the builder [here](https://residency.admit.org/program-list-builder) on [admit.org](https://residency.admit.org/program-list-builder) along with a few other neat features. 

https://preview.redd.it/iy4opzcgzeif1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fae978a2e41c3e2c2f7d53216bb7591d34d6c3e

It accounts for a majority of the high power variables that go into the screening and interview selection process. When testing it with dozens of residents, the builder was \~94% accurate in including the program they matched at in the recommended list.

The reason I made the program list builder + signal algo was because I saw so many applicants missing out on their full potential simply because they weren't making the right lists - either by applying to the wrong programs and having to reapply for the match, or by not strategically using their signals to maximize interviews. As a low SES applicant, I was also surprised to see that there are services charging thousands of dollars for tools like this which should be free. I know how much harder the process can be when you don’t have the same resources others do, so I figured I would spend the time to build this.

If it wasn't already apparent, the two most important variables that go into the match is your med school prestige (which, depending on your school and target program, can be worth up to 30 Step 2 points) and research items. Play around with the builder, and feel free to DM me if you spot anything that could be improved / feels inaccurate with the program recommendations.

The other cool feature on Admit is the application manager, which you can use to keep track of your applications during the cycle and take notes of each program along the interview trail. For accounts that opt in to sharing received interviews publicly, they get aggregated on the interview invites tab like the spreadsheet which you can see below.

Reddit,medicalschool,public service forgiveness,1lj22na,What I wish I knew about money as a PGY-1,"The jump from MS-4 to intern means long hours, a new city and a first real paycheck. As a PGY-4, this is a quick primer on some financial things I wish I did during PGY-1.

Agree or disagree, you need to have a plan or those paychecks might evaporate!

...

1. **Decode your first pay stub** 
   * Know your gross vs. net, how much goes to federal/state taxes, Social Security/Medicare, and (if your hospital is unionized) dues. 
   * Build a ""zero‑based"" budget so every dollar has a job: rent, meal prep, loan payment, savings, fun. Apps like YNAB help automate it.
2. **Start (or top‑up) an emergency fund** 
   * Aim for one month of bare‑bones expenses by December and three months by the end of PGY‑1. High‑yield savings accounts are still paying about 4 percent in mid‑2025, so park the cash there.
3. **Tackle student loans early** 
   * SAVE is on hold: court rulings have paused new enrollment and placed current SAVE borrowers in interest‑free forbearance until at least fall 2025, leaving repayment rules in flux. 
   * While the dust settles, keep your servicer in the loop and recertify income when asked. If Public Service Loan Forgiveness is in your future, stay on a qualifying income‑driven plan (PAYE/ICR) and keep every 120‑payment receipt. 
   * Private refinancing can wait; federal protections are worth more than a slightly lower rate right now.
4. **Max free money, then invest** 
   * Contribute at least enough to capture any employer 403(b)/401(k) match. The 2025 employee contribution cap is $23,500. 
   * If you can save more, open a Roth IRA (limit $7,000) while your income (and tax bracket) is low. Once you're attending you likely will surpass the Roth income limit
   * No match? Consider directing extra dollars toward high‑interest debt first.
5. **Evaluate your benefits package** 
   * Health insurance: If you chose the high deductible plan, max the HSA ($4,300 for self / $8,550 family in 2025). It's ""triple‑tax‑advantaged""
   * Disability insurance: Buy an own‑occupation policy before any future medical issues raise premiums. It's best to do this during residency
   * Hospital perks: Meal stipends, scrub allowances, public‑transit subsidies are basically use them or lose them.
6. **Keep lifestyle creep in check** 
   * Easy to say, hard to do especially if you already renting above your means
   * Stay in a modest apartment (obv roommates help) b/c the ""live like a student"" mantra buys you flexibility later
7. **Kill high‑interest debt** 
   * Credit APRs are near 20 percent or more. Turn on autopay to pay off the balance every month 
   * Consider a cash back card for everyday expenses; set it to autopay in full to dodge late fees and build credit (some cards are now ""debit"" cards under the hood but help you build credit!)
8. **Track progress by rotation** 
   * At the end of each block, spend 15 minutes to look at and/or update your net worth (loans, savings, retirement balances)
   * Review spending categories (did nights wreck your DoorDash bill? I might be projecting here)
   * Adjust goals for the next block (for example, bump your Roth contribution).
9. **Plan for taxation** 
   * Set aside cash for possible state under withholding if you moonlight (moonlighting can push you into a higher tax bracket). 
   * Keep receipts for board exam fees and other fees that come from the job; some may be deductible under current IRS thresholds.

Residency is a marathon. Automate what you can, review regularly, and grant yourself grace when 28‑hour calls derail your budgeting. 

And it's ok to get yourself a sweet treat every once in a while :)

Reddit,medicalschool,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1lrlwg4,Hot Take - New Market For Private Schools With Existing Sky High Tuition,"It's absolutely terrible that  powers that be value professional education so little that its no longer worth public loan support. To be honest, I'm not the least bit surprised. It's not uncommon hear rhetoric about ""making it yourself without an education"" or simply  negative sentiment against universities.

Sadly, what I forecast actually happening is that any of the private medical schools will capitalize on a new market opening up. Historically these schools operated because the public loans allowed students to pay their 50-70k tuition a year. As much as these schools operate as a place of medical education, they are also businesses. I simply can't imagine any leaders with business experience not trying to capitalize on this opportunity for new business revenue to ensure added security for enrollment numbers.

  
My forecast is that these schools will now:

* Directly partner with private lenders. They will advertise the loans as being directly offered by the school. In reality they are taking a commission on funneling leads to a private lender.  In actuality the lender subsidizes the school's operating cost (i.e. tuition) by offering these high risk, high interest loans.
* Schools with enough capital eventually becoming the lenders themselves to finance the final two years of their students.

The vote is THIS WEEK. Your call to an undecided Senator will truly decide the future of American healthcare for all. **We are just TWO “NO” votes away from stopping this**. Your call to an undecided Senator could decide the future of American healthcare.

**What Is Happening?**

* The Senate is voting on the bill that would end Grad PLUS loans for medical students
* The Grad PLUS program fully covers the cost of medical school.
* Without the loan, the average medical student ($200,000-$400,000 in debt on) will have no way to fully pay it off unless their family is wealthy, or they would have to turn to predatory private loans.

**Why does this matter?**

* 70–75% of med students rely on Grad PLUS loans.
* Low- and middle-income students will be shut out. Medicine will become a field only for the wealthy.
* The U.S. is already projected to be short 86,000 physicians by 2036. This bill could make this issue a permanent crisis across the nation.
* Rural and underserved communities will suffer most. These are the doctors most likely to serve where they’re needed most.
* Diversity in medicine will plummet. Less representation means worse outcomes for patients.

**Why your calls matter NOW:**

* The Senate advanced the bill by 51–49, with two Republicans joined all Democrats in opposition, but final passage not guaranteed
* Senators are currently in hot water. Many are undecided and listening to their constituents in this final week.
*  Staffers track every call—a flood of calls can change a Senator’s vote.
* If the Senate passes this, the House can still remove the clause—but only if there’s a massive public outcry

Reddit,medicalschool,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1lmrd80,"15 Years of financial tracking through medical school, residency, fellowship, and attendinghood (UPDATE #11)","Hi all,  

I’ve made a number of financially-focused posts starting 6 years ago as a new hospital-employed interventional pain management attending. [Past posts and large Q&amp;As can be seen in my post history.](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrPayItBack/submitted/) I have said that I would continue to provide updates and answer questions as I made progress on my financial goals. Much of this will be carried over from previous entries so that each post can stand on its own, but I have edited anything relevant.
  
**I graduated medical school in 2014 with $160k in loans (about $210,000 in 2024 dollars), which was just about the median at the time. Clearly average loan burden is higher now. I am also in pain management which is generally a well-compensated field. I make about 40th percentile for my specialty because I am an employee and work reasonable hours, but it is still more than many physicians. Finally, I lost my dad unexpectedly in mid-2020 and therefore received an approximately $200k inheritance. In my opinion, all this does not change the principles of smart financial management, though it is certainly accelerating the timeframe. But if you feel these factors trump all else, you may not get much out of the rest of the post. This is not an exhaustive list of my privileges, but I always try to put them front and center.**  
  
I have been an attending now for 6 years. I work essentially business hours, 7:30a-4:00p, no nights, weekends, holidays, or call. I spend 2 days per week in clinic and 3 in the fluoro suite. In addition to holidays and weekends I get 7 weeks (35 business days) off per year, 2 weeks of which is for CME.  
  
As in the past, my major goal has been to show one person’s attempt to put the framework of smart physician personal finance into practice a la resources like the [White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com). **I have never held myself up either as an ideal, just a real-world example of what it can look like when you’re trying to do the ‘right thing’.**  
  
Over the years my goals have shifted from student loan payoff to home ownership to now thinking about when stepping back from clinical medicine might be possible and what that might look like. I do not have any solid goals for early retirement, but I would like to be work-optional by my early 50s (empty nest) and currently feel about on track for that. I have mused about going to 0.9 or 0.8 FTE. We’ll see.  
  
To repeat my prior posts, I’ve been tracking my income, spending, budget, and net worth since starting medical school in 2010.   
  
**Basic Stats**  
* I took out about $160k in medical school loans (equivalent to about $215k in 2025 dollars) and graduated in 2014. This was a very different time in terms of tuition, and I was helped by going to a public in-state school and a few need-based grants. I got married in 2014 as well, and our overall debt (student loans, cars, and credit cards) was $225k when I graduated (or about $300k in 2025 dollars).  
* I started off residency putting some money towards loans every month and was able to get them down to around $200k. I did have a 403b match at my residency program so I contributed enough to max this, and I tried to contribute to a Roth IRA when I could. My wife was working as well. With the birth of our first kid in 2017 we started treading water financially.   
* Fellowship pushed things further down, between my wife going stay-at-home, an unexpected car replacement, and probably overall less disciplined spending since the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ was so close. I maxed out our Roth IRAs, but otherwise did not save at all. I did not have a work retirement plan available.  
* Salary during my five years of GME training was $55-65k in medium cost-of-living cities. My wife worked for the first four of those years, bringing home $40-45k.  
* We now are in a relatively low cost-of-living city. Base salary at my current job is $420,000. I receive an annual bonus which is generally around $20,000 for total comp of around $440,000.  
* My wife works very part time bringing in $10-20k/year pre-tax.  
* We finishing paying off my student loans in December 2022, after about 3.5 years as an attending.  
  
**Income and Spending**  
  
In typical year given ~$450,000 pre-tax income, about $125,000 will go to taxes, $140,000 will go to spending, and $185,000 to savings. I have started taking my foot off the savings pedal ever so slightly this year, allowing our spending to drift up by approximately the inflation rate. I max out my 403b, 457, and our Roth IRAs each year. I put $8,000 per child into a 529 annually, and contribute $7,000 per month to a taxable account (this was $10,000/month until this year).   
  
Since I became an attending 6 years ago, we have increased our net worth by **$1,855,000**, or an average of **$26,500 per month** over 70 months. Approximately $200,000 of this unfortunately came from an inheritance from my father between 2020-2021, but it is mostly a reflection of consistent saving and investing and maintenance of a reasonable lifestyle. Coming out of training it took us 10 months to go from a net worth low of -$156,000 to $0, with significant continued gains in 2020 and 2021. We remained about even in 2022, between the market pullback, buying a house, and getting a new car. In 2023 and 2024 things really began to skyrocket, with a combined gain of nearly $800,000. 2025 has unsurprisingly been much more volatile and I expect this to continue for the next few years.  
  
**Disability Insurance**  
I purchased an individual own-occupation disability insurance policy from Ameritas near the end of my residency training. The initial benefit was $5,000/month for a premium of $178/month. When I signed my attending contract at the end of fellowship, I exercised the future-increase rider that I had purchased and increased this to a benefit of $15,000/month for a premium of $472/month. This is a little bit more expensive than it might otherwise have been since I was over 30 when I bought the policy, and I have a couple minor chronic conditions. Like all disability insurance purchased with post-tax dollars, this payout would be tax-free at the time of disbursement.  
  
You want disability insurance to afford a decent (not necessarily ideal) standard of living, and to allow for saving for retirement. Long-term disability will not pay out after age 65, so this has to be considered. For our current level of spending and our ability to make discretionary cuts if needed, the $180,000 per year post-tax benefit should allow for this. Because of the own-occupation rider I would also be allowed to work in another occupation without reducing my benefit. Disability (and life) insurance are most important in early career, given low assets, high debt, and a long runway of future potential earnings. As you build up your own stash (and have fewer years to work/live!), they become less important and can eventually be canceled.   
  
**Life Insurance**  
I have three separate individual term life insurance policies, plus what is offered by my work. I use a laddering strategy, so I have three separate policies $1,000,000 each at 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years. This way my life insurance coverage phases out as I become less and less likely to need it due to accumulation of savings. For this I pay a combined $186/month, again a little higher because of some chronic conditions. The first policy will phase out in 2030. In addition to this I have a $1,000,000 policy offered through my work for pennies each month, for a grand total of $4,000,000, or a little shy of 10x my base salary.  
  
We have a $500,000 20-year policy for my wife at $17/month, and she also gets a $50,000 policy through my work. She is stay-at-home, but there would obviously be increased childcare expenses if anything were to happen to her.  
  
**Auto Insurance**  
Through Progressive. We pay $97/month for two vehicles, 2016 and 2021 model years. We plan to replace cars every 5-10 years. 
  
**Umbrella Insurance**  
Through Progressive. We pay $20/month for $1,000,000 in coverage. I plan to increase this to $2,000,000 at some point (though I say this every year). There’s no hard and fast rule for how much to carry, but most people seem to use an amount that approximates net worth.  
  
**Housing**  
For the first 3 years of my attending job, we rented a house for $1,850/month plus utilities. We bought a house in summer 2022 with a purchase price of $635,000, and we financed with 10% down on a physician mortgage at a 4.00% interest rate. Our timing didn’t get us the rock bottom for rates, but we squeaked in under the wire before they really started skyrocketing. Total monthly payment is $3,580, and $2,730 is the mortgage itself. We used Truist and the experience was just okay. It felt like I had to micromanage quite a bit, but ultimately we got through the process with no major hiccups.
  
Whether to rent or buy is a common topic for trainees and new attendings. I generally subscribe to the idea that you should be 100% positive that you will be there for several years to even consider buying, like a longer residency or after the first few years of a job once you’ve made sure it’s a fit. Looking back we almost certainly would have come out ahead if we had bought straight away in 2019, but it would have been a terrifying time with COVID and not knowing if I was going to keep my job or have to sell at a loss. And I certainly wouldn’t have a $1,000,000+ investment portfolio.  
  
**Student Loans**  
I refinanced a portion of my student loans (federal loans that were unsubsidized, with a higher interest rate) with Laurel Road (formerly DRB) during residency. I refinanced to a variable rate at ~4%, down from the federal rate of 6.8%. This variable rate went up and down but mostly stayed about the same. At the end of fellowship I refinanced again with Earnest, this time the entirety of my student debt. I took a 5-year term with a variable interest rate at 2.5%. For 2.5 years it only went down, and it bottomed out at 0.16% for much of 2021. In 2022 it climbed back up again to around 4%, which is where it was when I paid it off. I refinanced my wife’s graduate school debt at around the same time, also to a variable rate 5-year term. I paid off her loans in a lump sum in early November 2021. At no point did I have loans affected by the interest/payment pause, and we would have been considerably better off if I had just never refinanced them, but that’s water under the bridge.  
  
**Savings**  
We use Ally which I have been very happy with. We typically have an emergency fund of ~$30-35k, which would cover about 3 months of expenses. In addition to this I have started filling sinking funds for house and auto, so I get less irritated when periodic expenses come up.  
  
**Investing**  
Our investments include my 403b, non-governmental 457, and Roth IRA, my wife’s solo 401k and Roth IRA, a taxable brokerage, as well as 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs for our two boys. Our kids were used in advertising for my wife’s business when it was getting off the ground, which allowed her to employ them and contribute to the IRAs. We are not actively contributing to the custodial IRAs at the moment.  
  
Across the retirement accounts and the taxable brokerage, our asset allocation is 63% US stocks, 18% international stocks, 10% US bonds, and 9% REITs. All in low-cost index funds. The 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs are in 100% US stock funds. Focus is on low cost, broad, passive funds. I do not have any holdings in direct real estate or syndications currently.  
  
I do have a smattering of cryptocurrency, a total of $10,000 principal, or ~1% of our investments. After going down to a low of $3,000, it’s most recently back up to about $20,000 or 100% gain. I still think it’s stupid.  
  
**Estate Planning**  
We have a living trust, wills, powers of attorney, and health care directives. I did these online with a company that did a good job (as confirmed by an attorney friend), but I think they no longer exist and we will probably just go with an in-person attorney next time we revise documents.   
  
**JUST SHOW ME THE CHART**  
Overall, this is what the journey has looked like to date:  
https://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reddit-NW-Trend-Jun25.png  
For the purposes of this chart, I have netted out our mortgage (home value minus remaining mortgage = equity as an asset).  

For the few of you that have further interest, I previously kept a blog [HERE](https://drpayitback.com) with a huge back-catalogue of posts though sparsely updated these days and I am probably going to let the hosting lapse very soon.

I use a laddering strategy, so I have three separate policies $1,000,000 each at 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years. This way my life insurance coverage phases out as I become less and less likely to need it due to accumulation of savings. For this I pay a combined $186/month, again a little higher because of some chronic conditions. The first policy will phase out in 2030. In addition to this I have a $1,000,000 policy offered through my work for pennies each month, for a grand total of $4,000,000, or a little shy of 10x my base salary.  
  
We have a $500,000 20-year policy for my wife at $17/month, and she also gets a $50,000 policy through my work. She is stay-at-home, but there would obviously be increased childcare expenses if anything were to happen to her.  
  
**Auto Insurance**  
Through Progressive. We pay $97/month for two vehicles, 2016 and 2021 model years. We plan to replace cars every 5-10 years. 
  
**Umbrella Insurance**  
Through Progressive. We pay $20/month for $1,000,000 in coverage. I plan to increase this to $2,000,000 at some point (though I say this every year). There’s no hard and fast rule for how much to carry, but most people seem to use an amount that approximates net worth.  
  
**Housing**  
For the first 3 years of my attending job, we rented a house for $1,850/month plus utilities. We bought a house in summer 2022 with a purchase price of $635,000, and we financed with 10% down on a physician mortgage at a 4.00% interest rate. Our timing didn’t get us the rock bottom for rates, but we squeaked in under the wire before they really started skyrocketing. Total monthly payment is $3,580, and $2,730 is the mortgage itself. We used Truist and the experience was just okay. It felt like I had to micromanage quite a bit, but ultimately we got through the process with no major hiccups.
  
Whether to rent or buy is a common topic for trainees and new attendings. I generally subscribe to the idea that you should be 100% positive that you will be there for several years to even consider buying, like a longer residency or after the first few years of a job once you’ve made sure it’s a fit. Looking back we almost certainly would have come out ahead if we had bought straight away in 2019, but it would have been a terrifying time with COVID and not knowing if I was going to keep my job or have to sell at a loss. And I certainly wouldn’t have a $1,000,000+ investment portfolio.  
  
**Student Loans**  
I refinanced a portion of my student loans (federal loans that were unsubsidized, with a higher interest rate) with Laurel Road (formerly DRB) during residency. I refinanced to a variable rate at ~4%, down from the federal rate of 6.8%. This variable rate went up and down but mostly stayed about the same. At the end of fellowship I refinanced again with Earnest, this time the entirety of my student debt. I took a 5-year term with a variable interest rate at 2.5%. For 2.5 years it only went down, and it bottomed out at 0.16% for much of 2021. In 2022 it climbed back up again to around 4%, which is where it was when I paid it off. I refinanced my wife’s graduate school debt at around the same time, also to a variable rate 5-year term. I paid off her loans in a lump sum in early November 2021. At no point did I have loans affected by the interest/payment pause, and we would have been considerably better off if I had just never refinanced them, but that’s water under the bridge.  
  
**Savings**  
We use Ally which I have been very happy with. We typically have an emergency fund of ~$30-35k, which would cover about 3 months of expenses. In addition to this I have started filling sinking funds for house and auto, so I get less irritated when periodic expenses come up.  
  
**Investing**  
Our investments include my 403b, non-governmental 457, and Roth IRA, my wife’s solo 401k and Roth IRA, a taxable brokerage, as well as 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs for our two boys. Our kids were used in advertising for my wife’s business when it was getting off the ground, which allowed her to employ them and contribute to the IRAs. We are not actively contributing to the custodial IRAs at the moment.  
  
Across the retirement accounts and the taxable brokerage, our asset allocation is 63% US stocks, 18% international stocks, 10% US bonds, and 9% REITs. All in low-cost index funds. The 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs are in 100% US stock funds. Focus is on low cost, broad, passive funds. I do not have any holdings in direct real estate or syndications currently.  
  
I do have a smattering of cryptocurrency, a total of $10,000 principal, or ~1% of our investments. After going down to a low of $3,000, it’s most recently back up to about $20,000 or 100% gain. I still think it’s stupid.  
  
**Estate Planning**  
We have a living trust, wills, powers of attorney, and health care directives. I did these online with a company that did a good job (as confirmed by an attorney friend), but I think they no longer exist and we will probably just go with an in-person attorney next time we revise documents.   
  
**JUST SHOW ME THE CHART**  
Overall, this is what the journey has looked like to date:  
https://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reddit-NW-Trend-Jun25.png  
For the purposes of this chart, I have netted out our mortgage (home value minus remaining mortgage = equity as an asset).  

For the few of you that have further interest, I previously kept a blog [HERE](https://drpayitback.com) with a huge back-catalogue of posts though sparsely updated these days and I am probably going to let the hosting lapse very soon.  

Happy to answer any questions, either pertaining to this post or previous ones, have a great day and good luck on July 1!",,,,

I’m a pharmacist but hoping you can use my letter as a template. Write your representatives especially the republicans.


Good morning Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern about the future of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, particularly for those of us who are already years into our service commitments. My wife and I are both pharmacists at ——— and ———-outside of ———. We entered healthcare with a commitment to serving others, and we care deeply about our patients.

PSLF and the nonprofit status of hospitals have been essential in enabling us to care for Pennsylvania’s population. However, recent discussions about eliminating PSLF or revoking hospitals’ nonprofit status put not only our financial stability at risk but also the future of healthcare access in Pennsylvania. If nonprofit hospitals lose their status, many healthcare workers—including my wife and me—could be disqualified from PSLF, making it significantly harder for professionals to remain in these critical roles.

Pennsylvania, particularly rural areas, is already facing severe shortages of nurses, pharmacists, and doctors. If PSLF or nonprofit hospital status is weakened or eliminated, we risk a drastic decline in healthcare professionals, further limiting access to care for many Pennsylvanians.

When we took out our loans, we entered into an agreement with the government, committing to years of hard work and service—even through the worst pandemic in a century. We simply ask for the chance to fulfill our commitment under the PSLF program. Without it, building a family and maintaining a stable future will become significantly more difficult for us and many others in similar positions.

As you consider policies affecting PSLF and nonprofit hospitals, I urge you to think of the long-term impact on rural Pennsylvania’s healthcare system and the patients who rely on it. Thank you for your time and consideration

Reddit,medicalschool,"""Public Service Loan Forgiveness""",1gkwgfa,PSLF isn’t going anywhere for current med Students and borrowers—here’s why you don’t need to panic,"Yes, Trump winning the election is bad news for a bunch of reasons. But for those freaking out about PSLF and whether it’s still a solid plan for debt relief, let’s cool down on spreading panic. **If you’re a current med student who’s taken out PSLF loans, or you’re a resident/attending already making payments, you’re in a safe spot for PSLF.** Here’s why:

Historically, legislative changes to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, have included provisions to ""grandfather"" existing borrowers. This means that **individuals who have already begun making PSLF-eligible payments would continue to benefit under the original terms, even if new legislation alters or ends the program for future borrowers.** For instance, previous proposals to modify or eliminate PSLF have often specified that current participants would not be affected. This approach of grandfathering isn’t unique to student loans—it's a common practice across various federal programs and policies. For example, in retirement and tax laws, when Congress has enacted changes that restrict or modify certain benefits, they have allowed people already participating to continue under the old rules. A notable example is changes to Roth IRA conversions; when tax rules were tightened, individuals who had already contributed under previous guidelines were allowed to maintain their benefits. Similarly, with Social Security benefits, when retirement age requirements have shifted, individuals close to retirement were grandfathered in to prevent disrupting their retirement plans.

Regarding Trump specifically and his past attempt at eliminating PSLF - During his last presidency, Trump proposed eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Notably, his fiscal year 2021 budget suggested ending PSLF for new borrowers as of July 1, 2020, effectively ""grandfathering"" in existing borrowers who had already taken out PSLF-eligible loans. This approach aimed to prevent disruptions for current participants while discontinuing the program for future borrowers. **In summary, although he did attempt to remove PSLF his proposed plan would have grandfathered in all of us – students who already had taken out PSLF-eligible loans. Furthermore, the plan allowed students grandfathered in to still take out more PSLF-eligible loans.** 

The one fair concerning change to PSLF, rather than eliminating it outright, could involve increasing the administrative burden—making the process more complex or strict for future borrowers. This might mean more paperwork, stricter documentation requirements, or tighter eligibility checks, which would make accessing forgiveness more cumbersome but not impossible. We’ve seen this happen with PSLF already; in the past, the program had high rejection rates due to complex requirements and confusion around eligible payments. However, recent efforts have shown that these issues can be addressed. For example, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and various student loan counseling services have developed resources to help borrowers navigate PSLF, even with its intricate rules. So, while an increase in administrative hurdles could make the process more challenging, it wouldn’t eliminate PSLF’s benefits. With careful planning and staying on top of your paperwork, your PSLF will be processed and any extra payments you made due to delays in processing will be refunded eventually. 

Bottom Line: **Stay informed and don’t fear monger**, current med students with PSLF-eligible loans and those who have started making payments should feel reassured that they are safe.

A lot of us have been hearing about new legislation (the so-called “big beautiful bill”) that’s supposed to put a cap on how much med students can borrow in federal loans.

Does anyone know for sure: Does this new loan cap apply to current med students, or only to new incoming classes starting after the bill goes into effect?

I’m trying to plan ahead financially, and I’d love any reliable info, official links, or insights if you’ve seen details about how this will work. Especially curious whether current students are “grandfathered in” or if each new loan application could fall under the new rules even for existing students.

Reddit,medicalschool,federal loan forgiveness,1lr3fg6,"Student Loan Changes Under the ""Big Beautiful Bill""","Hey guys. I've included important details that affect **federal** student loans borrowers as part of the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" I think ALL new students should be aware of these changes. I hope this helps!

# Overall Federal Student Loan Cap: $257,000

* This is the **lifetime borrowing limit** for all federal student loans **per borrower**.
* **Does NOT include Parent PLUS loans.**
* Includes all loan types: undergraduate, graduate, and professional (med/law/dental).

# Bachelor’s Degree (Undergraduate)

* Subject to **existing annual limits** (e.g., $5,500–$7,500/year depending on dependency and year in school).
* Undergraduate loans **count toward the $257k total**. Total loans capped at $31,000 for dependent and $57,500 for independent students.

**Subsidized loans are NOT eliminated** — Senate version kept them.

# Master’s or General Graduate Programs

* New borrowing is **capped at $100,000 lifetime** for all non-professional graduate programs.
* New annual borrowing limit of **$20,500 per year**
* Existing Grad PLUS loans are going away — only unsubsidized loans will remain.
* This $100k cap is part of the $257k total.

Example: If you borrow $50k in undergrad, you can still borrow up to $100k in grad school — but you’ll hit $160k of the $257k total.

# Med School / Law School / Dental (Professional Programs)

* Capped at **$200,000 total** borrowing for these programs.
* New annual borrowing limit of **$50,000 per year**.
* This is a **sub-limit inside the $257k total cap**.

**Grad PLUS loans will be eliminated for new borrowing** after July 1, 2026.

# You CANNOT Exceed:

* $257,000 in total borrowing (lifetime)
* $100,000 for general grad programs
* $200,000 for professional med/law/dental programs

**So even if you're allowed to borrow $200k for med school, you only get that** ***if*** **you haven’t already borrowed too much for undergrad or grad.**

# Effective Date &amp; Grandfathering

* Changes apply to **new loans disbursed after July 1, 2026**.
* Students who are **actively enrolled** in a grad or prof program AND have **already** taken out at least one Grad PLUS loan for that program **before** July 1, 2026, can keep borrowing Grad PLUS loans through the 2028-2029 school year.
* **Loans you received before July 1, 2026** keep their old rules and are not affected by the new borrowing caps. HOWEVER, any **new loans** you take out after that date will be **limited** by the new caps, and your **current** loan balance will count against the **new** borrowing limits. You don’t have to pay back or change the terms of your old loans early. **Exception** for ONLY Grad PLUS (as explained before).

# New Student Loan Repayment Plans

* Only 2 federal repayment plans will be available beginning on July 1, 2026:
* **RAP (Repayment Assistance Plan)** – An income-based repayment plan that uses your total income (AGI) and applies a tiered % (1–10%) to calculate payments. *Married borrowers can file taxes separately to exclude spouse’s income.*
* **Standard Repayment Plan** – A fixed monthly payment plan based on your loan balance. Term ranges from 10 to 25 years depending on how much you owe.
* Existing IDR plans like SAVE, PAYE, IBR, and ICR will be **phased out by July 1, 2028**. Most borrowers will be automatically moved into RAP unless they opt out.
* If you're a new borrower starting **after July 1, 2026**, you'll only be able to choose between RAP or the Standard Plan.
* **NOTE:** RAP has A LOT of technical details that I did not post here.",1751583513.0,2025-07-03 15:58:33,/r/medicalschool/comments/1lr3fg6/student_loan_changes_under_the_big_beautiful_bill/,Ok-Dragonfruit-5035,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lr3fg6/student_loan_changes_under_the_big_beautiful_bill/,526.0,0.99,191.0,False,self.medicalschool,True,"Student Loan Changes Under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" Hey guys.

Reddit,medicalschool,loan forgiveness program,1lf4gce,Trying to find my passion outside of med school,"Hello everyone and welcome to an update in my life, otherwise known as the *Mini-Midi-Maxi Failure Chronicles*, a Tragic Comedy! Sorry, I'm a bit out of sorts over the past two months since I am still unemployed and currently almost $200k in debt and humor is about the only coping mechanism I've got left at this point. Some of you may have seen my post several months ago on the r/Step1 when I told the story of failing Step 1 for the final time and being withdrawn from from my MD program. Update since then: I have been graciously allowed to finish their Master in Medical Science program so at least I'll have a degree out of this whole mess and I'm feeling better every day other than the joblessness (biotech/biomed field is in shambles atm so I'm not surprised) so at least there's that 😄 



In case you're not into epically long posts that Homer would be proud of, here's the **TLDR version**: I got into med school unexpectedly in a comedy of errors, struggled epically, failed Step 1 after 3 attempts, left med school, and am looking for advice on finding what to do with the next phase of my life since med school has been the goal and my passion for so long.

🎇🎆**Now for the advice seeking part**. Basically, the only thing that's a bigger mess than me right now is the world around me which seems to essentially be on fire atm. I'm trying to figure out what direction I should take my life in careerwise. Short-term obviously, is find any job so I can pay my bills. I'm struggling with that since recent events have kinda taken a blowtorch to the scientific and research field and many companies are pulling back on hiring as a result. The ones that aren't now have enormous amounts of people all applying for the same job so competition is fierce. In addition, jobs outside my field that I've applied to have usually told me that I'm overqualified (two bachelor degrees and the one master in progress apparently fails to overcome the sheer desperation I'm displaying in every job application) or lack experience. I'm looking for more long-term advice - what does one do with half a medical school education after all? Everything I've thought up has involved going back to school eventually - that's where the interesting, but lucrative careers seem to be and I'm not getting any longer (early 30s). I've thought about genetic counseling (I had actually planned to possibly sub-specializing in Medical Genetics when I was still in med school because that was my fave class) but I'm worried about going back to school and pigeon-holing myself into a degree with only one career path. I can see myself still working in healthcare on the patient-treating side (I am not a business person and computer science/coding stuff bores me) or just generally in the biomedical field (I like being involved in research but not necessarily leading it). Does anyone have any advice or know of someone who exited stage left on medical school and what they're doing now? As an aside, I will say that I absolutely HATE leaving things undone and I know that my half-finished medical degree is going to nag at me for years to come. It bothered me so much that I even tried to look up information to see if anyone ever went back after an experience like mine or if that's even possible. I found out that it is technically possible but darn nearly impossible to accomplish, which is to be expected. I freely admit this would likely be far off in the future for me if I did attempt it but I'm curious - does anyone know of someone 🎆🎇



**The** **Homer Epic Version of Events**: 

To be not-so-brief, here's the deal - I applied for medical school back in 2020 and put ""Mini"" effort in because I assumed I wouldn't get in on my first application cycle. To my ""Midi"" surprise, I got waitlisted at one of my back-up schools. Then the ""Maxi"" shock - I came off the waitlist and I was officially a med student in a state across the country that I had no connection to, a medical school I hadn't toured (COVID lockdown), and a city that I knew little about. Looking back now, it really was a comedy of errors - I expected that I would have another year to get my affairs in order (I'm a first gen, nontraditional student and already had may of the trappings of post-undergrad life - a stable job, a good car, a great apartment full of personal effects, decent amount in my savings account and was working on paying down my approximately $20k in consumer debt and $40k in student loans). I had myself budgeted out for the next year and knew that I would be in perfect position financially and personally to enter medical school the **following year,** not the current one (2021 at the time). I felt very unsure about accepting and matriculating but I figured that you don't look a gift horse in the mouth (so many people want to go to med school and so few get in after all) so ultimately I decided I was going to make the best of this situation. Boy howdy, that was a mistake! I should have deferred for a year or re-applied in the following cycle, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.

Now here's the ""*Failure Chronicles*"" part of the story - I got through M1 and M2 by the skin of my teeth. I struggled over so many things - I could not for the life of me find a study method that worked for long-term retention (and since so many of med school classes build on each other getting behind in the curriculum is a very, very bad thing), I was dealing with health issues (physical and mental) after a lifetime of zero serious problems, and I could barely find (and frequently didn't) enough money to make ends meet after my budget was blown out-of-the-water by pandemic inflation and the higher cost of living in my school's city. Savings - decimated. Income - nonexistent other than my financial aid. I kid you not when I say I was living off of ramen, beans and rice - that was literally all I could afford and it stretched far enough that no one could tell I was struggling with food. The only way I could make ends meet was to use credit cards for essentials which of course only made the money problem worse. Then the problems back home started - several unexpected deaths in the family and a sibling struggling with depression and SI. By the time M2 finished up, I was a metaphorical wreck with one panic attack and one phone call to the 988 Crisis hotline each under my belt and I was now almost $35k in consumer debt and $200k in student debt. 

I knew that I was not ready for Step 1 and my school was doing what they could to help me but its hard to try to relearn 2 years of material during dedicated. I did what I could but ultimately didn't pass Step 1. I was placed on a leave of absence for academic failure. Since I was on a LOA I received no financial aid and would only be able to stay in my university-affiliated apartment until the beginning of the following semester (four months away) and needed to move out. Since I had no financial aid and no job, I couldn't afford to stay in the city without help. Since I had no safety net in the area (no family or friends close by to stay with), I had to make the 9+ hour move back to my parent's place in our home state. Then to add insult to injury, in the last week before move-out, my ailing health reared its ugly head and I got really sick and ended up in the hospital while my treatment team decided if I needed surgery or not - 2 days before my family was due to show-up and help me move out. I was eventually discharged and had to go back to my half-packed apartment to rush and finish the job the day before they arrived, still in pain but with few options because of the deadline for move-out. I just barely got it done as they pulled up the following morning with the moving truck. We packed up and were on the road.

I have never been in so much misery/pain nor felt so ashamed in my entire life as I did on that drive back home. In between the bouts of shame, I would be struck by these periods of numbness followed by bouts of lethargy. I can freely admit now that those bouts of lethargy probably saved my life - if I had more energy, I probably would have opened the passenger door of my sibling's car when we were deep in the mountains and taken my chances. I told almost no one what had happened or about my departure - just my school and my immediate family knew about the way my life imploded.

It took a few weeks but I was eventually able to start to pick up the pieces and start again. My school had been generous - I hadn't been kicked out and I would be allowed time to get my affairs in order and test again. I finally got some diagnoses for my ailments, started treatment and was doing my best to find new study habits so I could pass Step 1 and get my life back on track. Well, this is called the Failure Chronicles for a reason unfortunately. Remember those unexpected family deaths? Oh, and the pandemic fueled inflation and cesspool of a job market that just would not quit? Yeah, that segued into a financial disaster of epic proportions that the whole family - immediate and extended - had to weather. We, my immediate family, supported them (my extended family) in their time of need because we were in slightly better position to do so (financial breadwinners for two families were the unfortunate dearly departed). They were barely on their feet and scraping by when my immediate family was slapped with the misfortune stick. Utilities were threatened to be shut off, debt collectors blowing up the phone, and we were on the brink of foreclosure. I figured that trying to study for Step from a cardboard box on the side of the street would be counterintuitive to a passing score, so I made the decision to stop full-time studying and return to the workforce until we could figure things out. That took a few months longer than we all expected as these things go 🙃 

By the time I was able to leave the job behind, I was up against the wall with the end of LOA fast approaching and a second Step 1 test date looming before me - only 2 months and 1 month away for each respectively. My test scores had vastly improved over the course of my LOA but it was still going to be a close call on passing for me since I gave up months of studying for work. All joking aside, I have no regrets about doing that - it was the right decision to make and I would do it again in a heartbeat. My family were the ones who helped me bring light and happiness and hope back into my life since moving home - when they were going through dark times, I could do no less for them. I took Step 1 for the second time and waited anxiously for that score report. Luck had not been on my side on test day - the form I got was practically teeming with questions from my worst subjects - but I had answered every question on the test with time remaining in each section. Then it was score release day. I opened the emailed, followed the link and... saw the words FAIL for the second time. 

I kid you not when I say I climbed out of desk chair, stretched out and just lay there - face down on the floor in my bedroom for probably about 2 solid hours. Just me, the carpet and the dust bunnies under my bed for company (I made a note to vacuum later - there were far more bunnies than I expected there to be). Eventually, I rolled over grabbed my tablet and looked at the score report again, this time beyond those big bold words at the top. It didn't take me long to find the positives - my score had vastly improved (which should probably inform you about how badly I failed the first attempt 😂) and I performed much better in the subjects that I had applied a new study method in. With a little more time, I probably would have been over that hump and had a passing score. I reached out to my school, who of course, had already seen the report as well. I wasn't sure what they were going to do with me - after all I was at the end of my LOA and I had not secured that elusive (at least for me) P that we all desperately wanted me to earn. I won't go in to the details here on this part because I don't wish to reveal too much identifying info about me or my school - still relatively few know about my whole situation - but suffice to say I was granted a final reprieve (my school is, as I previously stated, fairly generous). I would be granted an sizeable extension on my LOA and allowed to test one final time. If at that point a passing score did not come to fruition then I would unfortunately be withdrawn from the MD program (I would be time-limited on the program at that point). I rejoiced - one more shot of the dream of my lifetime! There was only one problem and it just so happened to be, big, green and smell like Mr. Krabs safe at the Krusty Krab.

The contract job I had taken up had temporarily replenished my savings but not enough to service my debts for the rest of my LOA. My CC companies kinda wanted their money back - who woulda guessed? jk  I knew I would have to go back to work full-time - it was the only option that made feasible sense. I also ambitiously hoped to pay down my debts so I could return to school in a much better financial situation so that history would not repeat itself - you know financial woes sending me into a tailspin of epic proportions, that sort of thing. That meant it would severely cut into my study time. I tried to land a WFH or hybrid job in my field that turned out to be damn near impossible to get with all the competition out there for the same positions. I applied for hundreds of in-person jobs up to a 2 hour commute my parent's place (a bustling mecca of biotech/biomed companies our home city is NOT). I managed to land a few interviews only to not be selected in the end (if I have to hear the words overqualified one more time I might flip an actual table). I eventually found a job locally through a staffing agency that paid less than half of what I was making at my previous job and just barely enough to make my minimum payments on my debts. But I got to work - monetarily and academically. 

It was hard - I freely admit that. I was sleeping maybe four hours a night, working M-F full-time and studying every evening after I got off work then 12-14 hours on the weekends. I took a half-day break once a week. I skipped out on just about everything - birthday parties, trips, movies, visits, even going grocery shopping with my family. If it was gonna take longer than an hour, I wasn't going - I was all but chained to my desk. And that's because I knew that there was just one last element of my study method that was missing and I was desperate to find it. When I was initially granted my LOA extension, I carefully calculated and mapped out my study plan subject by subject so I knew how much time I needed to get to the end of the road before the end. Sadly, this road map hinged on two factors: 1) that I would find a good enough job that I would be able to leave and study full-time for at least 3 months before my test date and 2) that I figured out that elusive missing study element. And I was 0-2 on both of those. 

In January, I received a reprieve - I finally found the missing study element and everything medicine-wise suddenly began to make sense in way it literally never had before. For the first time in almost 3 years, I felt like I wasn't a imposter masquerading a medical student and that I deserve to be in medical school. That study revelation just came a bit little late in game for me. It was then quickly followed by another hospital admission for me (universe readjusting itself for my brief amount of good fortune perhaps). I also received a late-hour reprieve from a family member that let me leave my job and return to full-time study. It all came together, as if the universe had a hand in righting my world. It just didn't come together quick enough - I didn't have enough time to cover all the subjects I had left with the new, improved study method. My test scores would fluctuate wildly - if the questions heavily covered the areas that I studied with the new study method, I knocked it out of the park (80s+). However, if they hit those subjects that I had yet to touch with the new study method? 60s on average. And thus my study period came to an end and it was test day once more. God, do I wish for so many things but none more than one more month of study time. It was gonna be close again this time, scorewise, closer than even before. But I felt confident going in - this was my best shot, my last shot, and I was gonna make it count.

Well, I don't need to remind you that this is called the *Failure Chronicles*, at this point. So we know how this story ends. I got my score back and for the third and final time, I saw the words FAIL. I came apart at the seams, just absolutely unraveled. I haven't cried that hard or that long since I was child at my first funeral of a much beloved grandparent. I cried so hard I actually burst two blood vessels in my eye and gave myself an eye twitch that took three weeks to go away. Revisiting that day is difficult and still painful. I could barely look around my room - I was surrounded by study materials, medical textbooks, a whiteboard full of notes and calendars, trappings of the medical student I no longer was. It was on my LinkedIn profile, my email signature, my pictures on social media. I could not escape in reality or virtually.  I couldn't even bare to look in the mirror because I feared that I knew what I would see - either an horrid imposter or nothing at all. I couldn't decide what would be worse. I finally went downstairs to break the news to my family where I questioned everything - why was I even let into med school, what was the point of the last four years, my dream of a lifetime (since I was 4 years old in fact) was dead and gone, that I hated myself and how absolutely idiotic I was, and I didn't know what to do with the rest of my life. In the wake of all that grief there was blessed numbness even though the tears had not abated fully. Eventually, I found the strength to pull myself together enough to contact my advisor, whom I had grown close to over the years, and then reached out to my school to inform them about my school and ask what I needed to do next. Though it felt like a knife digging in and scraping into my open wounds, I packed away my school materials as best I could, changed my social profiles, and email that same day so save myself from some of the anguish seeing those things caused.

Once again, I gonna skim over some details here (too much identifying info), but needless to say, my school and I settled matters and I was given the opportunity to join the their Masters of Medical Science program which I accepted. Let me also say this, because I know some people are probably wondering this - I am 100% not mad at my school. Like at all. They have been kind, generous, considerate, supportive, and extraordinarily understanding of my situation. They have been with me every step of the way and provided as many solutions as they could when they were able to. Unfortunately, the solutions I needed were beyond their ability to provide. We all wished that this story had a different outcome but that it is life. And it is the same life that we see when it comes to patients whose lives don't work out the way they expect or what them to. At times I find it difficult to articulate my experience over the past few weeks, I've also been struck by a multitude of feelings - grief (seeing pictures of my OG medical school class graduating made me feel like I couldn't breathe for awhile) &amp; anxiety chief among them but also strangely enough, relief too. I'll continue to explore those feelings over the coming months and years as I start living my life again. And so ends the *Failure Chronicles*, a tale of miniature and moderate surprises and maximum failures.

I have to admit that writing this post has been cathartic for me - to write down the whole story. I hope it doesn't break the community rules and it can stay up in its entirety. But if not, so be it. I'll treat it as a writing exercise 😉",1750317086.0,2025-06-19 00:11:26,/r/medicalschool/comments/1lf4gce/trying_to_find_my_passion_outside_of_med_school/,Ok_Try2947,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lf4gce/trying_to_find_my_passion_outside_of_med_school/,7.0,0.65,5.0,False,self.medicalschool,True,"Trying to find my passion outside of med school Hello everyone and welcome to an update in my life, otherwise known as the *Mini-Midi-Maxi Failure Chronicles*, a Tragic Comedy! Sorry, I'm a bit out of sorts over the past two months since I am still unemployed and currently almost $200k in debt and humor is about the only coping mechanism I've got left at this point. Some of you may have seen my post several months ago on the r/Step1 when I told the story of failing Step 1 for the final time and being withdrawn from from my MD program. Update since then: I have been graciously allowed to finish their Master in Medical Science program so at least I'll have a degree out of this whole mess and I'm feeling better every day other than the joblessness (biotech/biomed field is in shambles atm so I'm not surprised) so at least there's that 😄 



In case you're not into epically long posts that Homer would be proud of, here's the **TLDR version**: I got into med school unexpectedly in a comedy of errors, struggled epically, failed Step 1 after 3 attempts, left med school, and am looking for advice on finding what to do with the next phase of my life since med school has been the goal and my passion for so long.

🎇🎆**Now for the advice seeking part**. Basically, the only thing that's a bigger mess than me right now is the world around me which seems to essentially be on fire atm. I'm trying to figure out what direction I should take my life in careerwise. Short-term obviously, is find any job so I can pay my bills. I'm struggling with that since recent events have kinda taken a blowtorch to the scientific and research field and many companies are pulling back on hiring as a result. The ones that aren't now have enormous amounts of people all applying for the same job so competition is fierce. In addition, jobs outside my field that I've applied to have usually told me that I'm overqualified (two bachelor degrees and the one master in progress apparently fails to overcome the sheer desperation I'm displaying in every job application) or lack experience. I'm looking for more long-term advice - what does one do with half a medical school education after all? Everything I've thought up has involved going back to school eventually - that's where the interesting, but lucrative careers seem to be and I'm not getting any longer (early 30s). I've thought about genetic counseling (I had actually planned to possibly sub-specializing in Medical Genetics when I was still in med school because that was my fave class) but I'm worried about going back to school and pigeon-holing myself into a degree with only one career path. I can see myself still working in healthcare on the patient-treating side (I am not a business person and computer science/coding stuff bores me) or just generally in the biomedical field (I like being involved in research but not necessarily leading it). Does anyone have any advice or know of someone who exited stage left on medical school and what they're doing now? As an aside, I will say that I absolutely HATE leaving things undone and I know that my half-finished medical degree is going to nag at me for years to come. It bothered me so much that I even tried to look up information to see if anyone ever went back after an experience like mine or if that's even possible. I found out that it is technically possible but darn nearly impossible to accomplish, which is to be expected. I freely admit this would likely be far off in the future for me if I did attempt it but I'm curious - does anyone know of someone 🎆🎇



**The** **Homer Epic Version of Events**: 

To be not-so-brief, here's the deal - I applied for medical school back in 2020 and put ""Mini"" effort in because I assumed I wouldn't get in on my first application cycle. To my ""Midi"" surprise, I got waitlisted at one of my back-up schools. Then the ""Maxi"" shock - I came off the waitlist and I was officially a med student in a state across the country that I had no connection to, a medical school I hadn't toured (COVID lockdown), and a city that I knew little about. Looking back now, it really was a comedy of errors - I expected that I would have another year to get my affairs in order (I'm a first gen, nontraditional student and already had may of the trappings of post-undergrad life - a stable job, a good car, a great apartment full of personal effects, decent amount in my savings account and was working on paying down my approximately $20k in consumer debt and $40k in student loans). I had myself budgeted out for the next year and knew that I would be in perfect position financially and personally to enter medical school the **following year,** not the current one (2021 at the time). I felt very unsure about accepting and matriculating but I figured that you don't look a gift horse in the mouth (so many people want to go to med school and so few get in after all) so ultimately I decided I was going to make the best of this situation. Boy howdy, that was a mistake! I should have deferred for a year or re-applied in the following cycle, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.

Now here's the ""*Failure Chronicles*"" part of the story - I got through M1 and M2 by the skin of my teeth. I struggled over so many things - I could not for the life of me find a study method that worked for long-term retention (and since so many of med school classes build on each other getting behind in the curriculum is a very, very bad thing), I was dealing with health issues (physical and mental) after a lifetime of zero serious problems, and I could barely find (and frequently didn't) enough money to make ends meet after my budget was blown out-of-the-water by pandemic inflation and the higher cost of living in my school's city. Savings - decimated. Income - nonexistent other than my financial aid. I kid you not when I say I was living off of ramen, beans and rice - that was literally all I could afford and it stretched far enough that no one could tell I was struggling with food. The only way I could make ends meet was to use credit cards for essentials which of course only made the money problem worse. Then the problems back home started - several unexpected deaths in the family and a sibling struggling with depression and SI. By the time M2 finished up, I was a metaphorical wreck with one panic attack and one phone call to the 988 Crisis hotline each under my belt and I was now almost $35k in consumer debt and $200k in student debt. 

I knew that I was not ready for Step 1 and my school was doing what they could to help me but its hard to try to relearn 2 years of material during dedicated.

* I’m currently enrolled at a U.S. DO school.
* I had to take a leave of absence (LOA) halfway through MS2 for health reasons.
* There are 2 options that I contemplating between right now:
   1. **Repeat second year** this July and stay on my current DO track.
   2. **Withdraw, study full‑time for Step 1, then transfer** to American Canadian University School of Medicine (ACUSOM) and join their incoming third‑year cohort in Spring 2026.

**What attracts me to the transfer route**

* I could avoid repeating an entire year (save a year's tuition as well) and instead focus all my energy on Step 1 (which is pass/fail).
* ACUSOM says they’ll slot me straight into core rotations once I pass.
* I’m genuinely fine committing to primary‑care specialties (FM, IM, peds, psych) if that’s the ceiling. Lifestyle is my priority.
* **My hometown IM program has all their residents as carribean or international graduates** 

**What worries me**

* I’d be leaving COCA accreditation for CAAM‑HP (ACUSOM’s accreditor). How will U.S. residency programs view that, especially after I’ve already trained in the U.S.?
* I’m unclear on ACUSOM’s exact match data. Their website lists first‑time match percentage but the sample size is tiny.
* Loan situation: I’d lose my current federal loans/grants and switch to private financing. That’s a much steeper interest rate.
* I know transfers can raise red flags on ERAS. Does the fact that I’d be switching from a DO curriculum to an international MD curriculum make it worse?

**What I’ve already decided**

* I’m 100 % okay sticking to primary care. I value patient continuity more than prestige, and I’m not aiming for highly competitive specialties.
* I think I could still do a fellowship afterwards for IM or EM even if I have to take a gap year in between (correct me if Im wrong)

**What I’m hoping to learn from you**

1. Have any of you (or classmates) transferred from a U.S. DO/MD school to an offshore MD after an LOA? How did residency programs respond?
2. Is skipping a repeat MS2 worth the uncertainty of an international transfer?
3. Any hidden pitfalls with ACUSOM specifically—clinical site quality, visa/licensing hurdles, Step 2 pass rates, etc.?
4. Would repeating MS2, graduating as a U.S. DO, and taking the extra year hurt my primary‑care prospects any less?

Thanks in advance for any insight—especially if you’ve matched primary care from an offshore school or have sat on a residency selection committee. Feel free to be brutally honest; I’d rather hear the bad news now than halfway through an unexpected detour.

Reddit,StudentLoans,student loan forgiveness,1n0tne6,Need help navigating my student loans under the SAVE plan - any advice is welcome!,"
Hello everybody, I wanted to reach out to you all primarily in regards to my student loans. I am currently $14,000 in student loan debt, and enrolled in the SAVE Plan.

My main question lies in the interest rates. Now that interest rates are accruing, I will accrue $207 every month of interest alone. To me, this is pretty high and I was wondering if I should choose between these 3 options:

1) Pay off the 3 loans with the highest interest rates, which I got after COVID and these loans all have 5% or 5.5% interest rate. These loans make up $6000 of the $14,000 that I currently have. Afterwards, I would only accrue $90 of interest every month instead of the $207.

2) Pay off the entire loan, this is the easiest and more straightforward option. BUT, the catch is...what if SAVE plan actually doesn't get nerfed by the government and somehow survives? Then, I would feel like I wasted ALL of my money...compared to the 1st option, which is kind of a best of both worlds type scenario. I slash the monthly accrued interest by around 55%, but at the same time I also dont have to put in ALL of the money, either, incase SAVE does somehow make it out alive

3) Pay nothing at all, and just ride out the $200, putting in complete and utter faith that the SAVE plan will succeed. This option is the riskiest, but also in-turn has the biggest payoff if all goes well in Congress

So sorry if I am making this sound like some sort of betting/gambling scenario...but the truth is that it kind of is!!! That is the crazy part about this whole situation, is that we cannot predict the future and know how this SAVE plan is going to play out...it could go in our favor our go completely AGAINST our favor. Before interest started accruing, it was no problem, but know...it is essentially a scare tactic that is putting on extra pressure. Basically trying to force us to make a move before the accrued interest gets really bad.

Thank you so much for anyone who has read through this, and thank you as well for any advice that you may have. I am all ears on this issue since I am sure many, MANY other people are going through the exact same thing.

I slash the monthly accrued interest by around 55%, but at the same time I also dont have to put in ALL of the money, either, incase SAVE does somehow make it out alive

3) Pay nothing at all, and just ride out the $200, putting in complete and utter faith that the SAVE plan will succeed. This option is the riskiest, but also in-turn has the biggest payoff if all goes well in Congress

So sorry if I am making this sound like some sort of betting/gambling scenario...but the truth is that it kind of is!!! That is the crazy part about this whole situation, is that we cannot predict the future and know how this SAVE plan is going to play out...it could go in our favor our go completely AGAINST our favor. Before interest started accruing, it was no problem, but know...it is essentially a scare tactic that is putting on extra pressure. Basically trying to force us to make a move before the accrued interest gets really bad.

Thank you so much for anyone who has read through this, and thank you as well for any advice that you may have. I am all ears on this issue since I am sure many, MANY other people are going through the exact same thing.

Reddit,StudentLoans,PSLF,1myhxki,Help please possibly $60k debt undergrad only with no help,"[TLDR AT BOTTOM!!] 

Hello! Sorry for the long text I’m really struggling, I’m a freshmen at my uni and I’m someone who doesn’t qualify for any sort of financial aid (except federal direct) so no work studies or anything for me. I am paying for my college on my own since my parents aren’t going to help which is the main part of my problems. I’m going instate and my term bill for the fall semester is estimated around $15,165.99 without aid and $11,949.99 with (federal direct aid is $3,215 per term). This means for the entire year it’s looking like $23,899.98 worth of private loans. For soph, junior, and senior however I’ll be looking for off campus housing which knocks my yearly tuition to around $12,152.78 a year I believe but that still means I’ll graduate undergrad with around $60k debt which is pretty bad and considering that I want to go to medical school and I’ll be well over $200k debt which is really weighing on me since they’ll likely be private loans (ik how predatory private loans are) I plan to get a part time job while at school but I don’t even know if that will help. My other option is to go to community college and transfer after two years but I will have to find an apartment and pay for it myself because my parents won’t as well as find a job and budget groceries and rent and transportation since I can’t drive. Living at home is not an option because my parents have told me I’m not going to be living at home. I don’t even know what kind of private loans I would get and since I can’t get a co-signer my options are limited but I am leaning towards college ave. Even if I gap and take a year off to save for college I have to move out and find an apartment anyways which is why I leaned towards dorming. Is $60k debt undergrad going to be ok or is it a life sentence waiting pls help..and thanks for reading all that text 😭

TLDR: No aid or parental help, $60k 4 year uni or CC 2 years transfer and $25k debt but pay for rent + transportation + living expenses while planning on going to med school :,( is $60k undergrad too dangerous or can I work hard after med school/residency to help pay off the possible $250-300k worth of private loans.


Edit: Just figured I could probably take more federal loans for med school as I would be able to file as independent so hopefully most of the $200k worth of loans would be federal so I could apply to PSLF but I’m not sure yet because of the big beautiful bill and cuz my parents tell me it won’t work 😓

Update: parents won’t co sign and they said I can’t live at home so I’m probably going to withdrawl from college and I really don’t know I’m scared ill have to live on the street but I’ll have to figure something out

Update 2 for anyone who cares: medical school is being dropped as a possibility ! Also looking to reduce my term bill to try to make it more of a doable amount. Still no private loans and not enough fed loans, looking into working or taking some time off no matter what it’ll be difficult 🥲 still not a lot of support from parents I guess it’s my fault for waiting till the last second anyways ",1755996123.0,2025-08-23 17:42:03,/r/StudentLoans/comments/1myhxki/help_please_possibly_60k_debt_undergrad_only_with/,PuzzleheadedAgency41,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1myhxki/help_please_possibly_60k_debt_undergrad_only_with/,0.0,0.4,48.0,False,self.StudentLoans,True,"Help please possibly $60k debt undergrad only with no help [TLDR AT BOTTOM!!] 

Hello! Sorry for the long text I’m really struggling, I’m a freshmen at my uni and I’m someone who doesn’t qualify for any sort of financial aid (except federal direct) so no work studies or anything for me. I am paying for my college on my own since my parents aren’t going to help which is the main part of my problems. I’m going instate and my term bill for the fall semester is estimated around $15,165.99 without aid and $11,949.99 with (federal direct aid is $3,215 per term). This means for the entire year it’s looking like $23,899.98 worth of private loans. For soph, junior, and senior however I’ll be looking for off campus housing which knocks my yearly tuition to around $12,152.78 a year I believe but that still means I’ll graduate undergrad with around $60k debt which is pretty bad and considering that I want to go to medical school and I’ll be well over $200k debt which is really weighing on me since they’ll likely be private loans (ik how predatory private loans are) I plan to get a part time job while at school but I don’t even know if that will help. My other option is to go to community college and transfer after two years but I will have to find an apartment and pay for it myself because my parents won’t as well as find a job and budget groceries and rent and transportation since I can’t drive. Living at home is not an option because my parents have told me I’m not going to be living at home. I don’t even know what kind of private loans I would get and since I can’t get a co-signer my options are limited but I am leaning towards college ave. Even if I gap and take a year off to save for college I have to move out and find an apartment anyways which is why I leaned towards dorming.

They put in a request to review my payment count.

Reddit,StudentLoans,public service forgiveness,1mwvmbq,The NEW (2025) process to get your student loans discharged through a physician's note for total and permanent disability,"**EDIT: This post  is the process for FEDERAL student loans ONLY and NOT private student loans. This edit addresses comments people made below my main post about private student loans:** With **private student loans** usually people use bankruptcy to discharge them but you also have to file an adversarial proceeding when you file for bankruptcy as the student loans are included in that (some lenders sometimes will discharge them due to disability and/or hardship but that is lender specific so talk with your lender). You will need to find out what your STATE rules are for documenting hardship and what standard they use (there are several standards, some are less demanding than others)  in your adversarial proceeding (different states use different standards).

See [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/bankruptcy](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/bankruptcy) to get started finding information about **bankruptcy** and student loans (private or federal).

=============

**Below is the (current as of August 2025) process to discharge FEDERAL student loans through a Physician's Letter route.**

**NOTE**: Netnet (disability site) is NOT where you get or upload applications discharge of student loans through total and permanent disability anymore. If you go to their website for that it says permanently closed. You will now do this through the Federal Student Aid site (see below).

For those of you in process with your student federal loan discharge due to total and permanent disability and uploaded your information to Nelnet your application is now being dealt with via the new Federal Student Aid process. If you go to the Federal Student Aid (url down further) and log in you can track the process of your application.   
  
A 7/30/25 announcement on the Federal Student Aid resources site announced that they are processing again all the applications that have been on hold since late December 2024. I'd suspect it will take time to deal with a 6+ month backlog. If you are close to running out of forbearance then call the Federal Student Aid folks (you may need to talk to a supervisor) and your servicer (if you don't know who that is you can find it on that same site once you have logged in) and ask whom you should contact to get it extended.  
  
For those of you who haven't applied yet the new process directions are further down. 

The good news is that the new form that needs filled out and signed by your doctor is WAY easier that is was even several months ago. No more tiny boxes for the medical person to write in (where nothing was read outside the box and no attachments were read). Instead you give basic personal information and your medical professional signs it (make sure their license number is fully legible) and then they fax it. That's it.

Anyway here is what I wrote up about how to do this and how to find things on the Federal Student Aid site.

A lot of the formatting got lost,  I can't upload the pdf or a word doc so I had to copy/paste, and I don't feel like fixing it all so... here you go (and if you private message me realize I am not on here very often).

**Discharge of Student Loans for Total and Permanent Disability**

There are 3 ways to discharge FEDERAL ONLY student loans through total and  permanent disability:

1. Through the VA (which has their own process – contact the VA)
2. Through Social Security Disability (which gets you social security disability monthly checks if you are approved). IF AND ONLY IF you have not yet been approved for SSD you can also file via method #3. BUT doing #3 has NO effect on getting social security disability or that process and isn't going to help that.
3. Through a Physician’s Letter (which does not get you social security disability monthly checks; you can file using this method regardless of age, but have to file this way if you are too old to get social security disability. You can also file this was while waiting for #2 to stop your payments sooner).

**THE PROCESS: for the third option – the Physician’s Letter.**

This new application is far less complicated than the original one. The original one required your physician to answer a number of questions. Now that person is only certifying that your disability is total and expected to last more than 60 month (5 years) without having to give any more information. As a result if they have filled out one before they are likely to be surprised by the change so be prepared to let them know the process has been updated.

**Here are the website to get the application and more information:**

[https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge)

**Here is the application and more information about that (same page you get sent to on Step 1b below):**

[https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/](https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/)

**The Process:**

If you need a representative to fill out the form for you go to: [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge#apply](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge#apply) and scroll down until you see that heading.

On the same page if you scroll down further it will give information about pausing your payments. That will be done automatically when you submit your application or you can call and tell them you are applying (see instructions on that page).

1. The application, DISCHARGE APPLICATION: TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY , is on

[https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/](https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/)

Call your physician’s office before you fill this out and find out what email they want you to use to have your application sent to them for your physician’s signature. You will put that in the application. If you don’t have that you will need to take your application to your doctor, have them sign it and then upload it.

**Navigating the application process (use the url in #1)**

a. Click on: Log in to start (If you don’t have an account create one, there is a link belong log in)

b. Choose: Loan Forgiveness and Discharge from the menu along the top of the page

c. Choose: Total and Permanent Disability

d. Scroll down that page and follow the directions on that page

e. You find the application under Medical Professional’s Certification on this page

f. Once on the page in ( e) scroll down until you reach: Medical Professional Information for more information

g. Just below (f) you will see How to Apply which gives more information

h. Just below (g) you will see the hot link that says Apply for TPD discharge, click on that

i. Click on the Start Button

j. Follow the directions

k. When you get to the page that asked for the physician’s email put that in. They will be sent the application to sign and submit it.

l. If you choose to print the form you will need to take it to their office for them to sign it and then you will have to upload it, fax it or mail it (instructions with that will tell you how)

**After your application is submitted:**

1. If your application is approved (it would appear approval will likely be automatic since the only thing the physician does is sign the application, before this change they had to justify why you were totally and permanently disabled so there could be a reason to deny you) there is a 3 year monitoring period (go to the above websites to read about the specifics). Your loans will be in forbearance while you are in the 3 year monitoring period so no interest will accumulate and no payments will be due.
2. At the end of the 3 years, if you meet the monitoring rules,  your loans are permanently discharged which is considered your formal discharge date (for example: approved application in 2024 means a permanent discharge in 2027).
3. **DESPITE WHAT THE WEBSITE SAYS** (they need to update it) **your discharge will NOT b**e **considered federal taxable income** (some states will still tax it although without a 1099-C I am not sure how they will know that) due to the budget law signed 7/4/25 which included a clause to exclude the discharged amount from being taxable. You will NOT receive a 1099-C. (Also students who die will not get a 1099-C on the remaining amount of their federal loan(s).
4. Note: **the law only explicitly mentioned student federal loans and not parents with federal Parent Plus loans** in that law change and so I am not sure if parents/Parent Plus loans will be included in the implementation of the new law or not. I got conflicting answers when I asked the Federal Student Aid dept, however someone in the comments mentioned they will be included. Also students (again not sure if that will include parents with Parent Plus loans as again the wording of the law only said student) who die with student federal loans will NOT get a 1099-C  so their estate will not pay taxes on any discharged amount. It would appear, but again this needs confirmed, if a parent co-signed a federal student loan and that student died or was declared disabled, satisfied the monitoring, since the loan would be discharged for one of those reason, then the parent wouldn't have to take over the loan and continue to make payments.
5. **To put your loans in forbearance** Your loans will AUTOMATICALLY be put in forbearance once you have applied while you are waiting for the decision. If you want them in forbearance PRIOR to submitting the application you need to go to [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge) and then scroll down until you find that heading.
6. If your application has not yet been processed and your forbearance is running out call your processor. There was a pause on processing them and they have started up again, however there is a backlog.
7. If you made any federal student loan payments after you submitted your application those payments will be returned to you if your application is approved.

**Monitoring:** If you are approved you will have a 3 year monitoring period and then your loans will be formally discharged. Be aware that many sites list outdated rules for monitoring. Below is a copy/paste from the Federal Student Aid webpage about the monitoring period (a discharge via the VA there is no monitoring).

Copy/paste starts here:

Once your discharge is approved, we will let you know that your loans and/or TEACH Grant service obligation have been discharged.

Depending on how you qualified, your loan holder will refund payments they received either

* on or after the effective date of the VA’s disability determination;
* after the date we received the SSA documentation; or
* after the date the medical professional certified your discharge application.

# Monitoring Period Requirement:

Did you qualify for TPD discharge through **SSA documents or a medical professional’s certification?** If so, you’ll go through a three-year post-discharge monitoring period after your discharge.

If you receive a new student loan under the Direct Loan Program or a new TEACH Grant during this monitoring period, you’ll lose your TPD discharge and have your discharged loans and/or TEACH Grant service obligation reinstated (repayment resumes). That means you’ll again be required to pay back your loans or fulfill your TEACH Grant obligation.

If your TPD discharge is based on documentation from the VA, you don’t have to go through a post-discharge monitoring period.

# Reinstated Loan or Grant Obligation:

If you lose your TPD discharge status, your loan or TEACH Grant service obligation will be reinstated.

# Going Back to School After TPD Discharge:

You can get a new Direct Loan or TEACH Grant after getting a TPD discharge. But to do so, you must do the following:

1. Give your school a letter from a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy/osteopathic medicine stating that you are once again able to engage in substantial gainful activity.
2. Sign a statement acknowledging that you can't get a TPD discharge of the new loan or TEACH Grant based on a disabling condition you already have unless that condition significantly deteriorates in the future.

In addition, if you’re still in the post-discharge [monitoring period](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge#postdischarge) when you get new Direct Loan or TEACH Grant, you will lose your discharge status and your discharged loan or TEACH Grant service obligation will be reinstated.

End of copy/paste.

**If your application is denied:**

1. You can reapply immediately or appeal. Denials should be rare because all that is happening now is your physician is signing that it is true you meet the criteria.
2. It would be prudent to call the Federal Student Aid office to find out why you were denied (typically it will be a paperwork mistake of not filling something out or not filling it out correctly or your physician did not sign it).

**Other Resources:**

The National Consumer Law Center - Student Loan Borrower Assistance has a general website with helpful information about dealing with student debt, default, the SAVE consolidation plan (monthly loan payment is the lowest percent of income of any consolidation programs), etc. It would be worth reading the information on that site (and on the Federal Student Aid site, url above, too).

[https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org](https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org)

If your loans are in default, through the end of Sept 2024 there is a Fresh Start program to deal with this. You have to get them out of default before you can apply to receive a disability discharge. More information here:

[https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/default-debt-collection/getting-out-of-default/fresh-start/](https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/default-debt-collection/getting-out-of-default/fresh-start/)

If you get your school loans cancelled thought bankruptcy (via Chapters 7, 11, or 13) using what is called an “adversarial proceeding” then having them discharged that way means that your student loan discharge isn’t taxed as it is NOT considered “ordinary income” (eg no 1099-C or any other tax form). Information about bankruptcy that includes student loans:

From the website: What changes should borrowers expect once the TPD program transition process is completed? - meaning those of you who are familiar with the nelnet site, it is no longer in existence and they are currently not managing that process (I do not know what is happening to those of you who uploaded your applications to nelnet before the transition. You will have to ask that from the Federal Student Aid people. Someone here has posted that there is a new vendor to deal with this).

Once the TPD program is moved to [studentaid.gov](http://studentaid.gov) in March (so it is there now), borrowers will be able to manage their TPD discharge application on studentaid.gov.

Borrowers will still be able to submit TPD applications by fax, email, or mail, but they will now have the option to submit their applications on [studentaid.gov](http://studentaid.gov) as well. According to the Department, borrowers will be able to perform the following tasks on studentaid.gov:

• Use form wizards to complete and submit their TPD application form;

• Track the status of their TPD applications;

• Digitally upload forms and information supporting their application for TPD discharge; Apply for reconsideration in the event their application is denied;

• Request forbearances while their TPD application is in process;

• Designate or revoke an authorized representative; and

• Get additional information about the TPD program.

**ADDITION to this post**  
For those who are interested here is a copy of the law, signed 7/4/25, about the changes to the 1099-C tax form. The short version: discharge of federal or private student loans due to death or disability of the student will not result in the student getting a 1099-C. As a result the student (or student's estate) will not pay FEDERAL taxes on the discharged amount (some states will still tax this money but with no 1099-C I am not sure how they would know). Parent Plus loans and what happens to parents who become disabled or die is not explicitly addressed in the law. I am presuming if parent cosigned a student's loan and the student loan is discharged due to death or disability then there is no loan left for them to copay on but who knows. Stranger interpretations could be made of this law.

This edit addresses comments people made below my main post about private student loans:** With **private student loans** usually people use bankruptcy to discharge them but you also have to file an adversarial proceeding when you file for bankruptcy as the student loans are included in that (some lenders sometimes will discharge them due to disability and/or hardship but that is lender specific so talk with your lender). You will need to find out what your STATE rules are for documenting hardship and what standard they use (there are several standards, some are less demanding than others)  in your adversarial proceeding (different states use different standards).

See [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/bankruptcy](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/bankruptcy) to get started finding information about **bankruptcy** and student loans (private or federal).

=============

**Below is the (current as of August 2025) process to discharge FEDERAL student loans through a Physician's Letter route.**

**NOTE**: Netnet (disability site) is NOT where you get or upload applications discharge of student loans through total and permanent disability anymore. If you go to their website for that it says permanently closed. You will now do this through the Federal Student Aid site (see below).

For those of you in process with your student federal loan discharge due to total and permanent disability and uploaded your information to Nelnet your application is now being dealt with via the new Federal Student Aid process. If you go to the Federal Student Aid (url down further) and log in you can track the process of your application.   
  
A 7/30/25 announcement on the Federal Student Aid resources site announced that they are processing again all the applications that have been on hold since late December 2024. I'd suspect it will take time to deal with a 6+ month backlog. If you are close to running out of forbearance then call the Federal Student Aid folks (you may need to talk to a supervisor) and your servicer (if you don't know who that is you can find it on that same site once you have logged in) and ask whom you should contact to get it extended.  
  
For those of you who haven't applied yet the new process directions are further down. 

The good news is that the new form that needs filled out and signed by your doctor is WAY easier that is was even several months ago. No more tiny boxes for the medical person to write in (where nothing was read outside the box and no attachments were read). Instead you give basic personal information and your medical professional signs it (make sure their license number is fully legible) and then they fax it. That's it.

Anyway here is what I wrote up about how to do this and how to find things on the Federal Student Aid site.

A lot of the formatting got lost,  I can't upload the pdf or a word doc so I had to copy/paste, and I don't feel like fixing it all so... here you go (and if you private message me realize I am not on here very often).

**Discharge of Student Loans for Total and Permanent Disability**

There are 3 ways to discharge FEDERAL ONLY student loans through total and  permanent disability:

1. Through the VA (which has their own process – contact the VA)
2. Through Social Security Disability (which gets you social security disability monthly checks if you are approved). IF AND ONLY IF you have not yet been approved for SSD you can also file via method #3. BUT doing #3 has NO effect on getting social security disability or that process and isn't going to help that.
3. Through a Physician’s Letter (which does not get you social security disability monthly checks; you can file using this method regardless of age, but have to file this way if you are too old to get social security disability. You can also file this was while waiting for #2 to stop your payments sooner).

**THE PROCESS: for the third option – the Physician’s Letter.**

This new application is far less complicated than the original one. The original one required your physician to answer a number of questions. Now that person is only certifying that your disability is total and expected to last more than 60 month (5 years) without having to give any more information. As a result if they have filled out one before they are likely to be surprised by the change so be prepared to let them know the process has been updated.

**Here are the website to get the application and more information:**

[https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge)

**Here is the application and more information about that (same page you get sent to on Step 1b below):**

[https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/](https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/)

**The Process:**

If you need a representative to fill out the form for you go to: [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge#apply](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge#apply) and scroll down until you see that heading.

On the same page if you scroll down further it will give information about pausing your payments. That will be done automatically when you submit your application or you can call and tell them you are applying (see instructions on that page).

1. The application, DISCHARGE APPLICATION: TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY , is on

[https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/](https://studentaid.gov/tpd-discharge/)

Call your physician’s office before you fill this out and find out what email they want you to use to have your application sent to them for your physician’s signature. You will put that in the application. If you don’t have that you will need to take your application to your doctor, have them sign it and then upload it.

**Navigating the application process (use the url in #1)**

a. Click on: Log in to start (If you don’t have an account create one, there is a link belong log in)

b. Choose: Loan Forgiveness and Discharge from the menu along the top of the page

c. Choose: Total and Permanent Disability

d. Scroll down that page and follow the directions on that page

e. You find the application under Medical Professional’s Certification on this page

f. Once on the page in ( e) scroll down until you reach: Medical Professional Information for more information

g. Just below (f) you will see How to Apply which gives more information

h. Just below (g) you will see the hot link that says Apply for TPD discharge, click on that

i. Click on the Start Button

j. Follow the directions

k. When you get to the page that asked for the physician’s email put that in. They will be sent the application to sign and submit it.

l. If you choose to print the form you will need to take it to their office for them to sign it and then you will have to upload it, fax it or mail it (instructions with that will tell you how)

**After your application is submitted:**

1. If your application is approved (it would appear approval will likely be automatic since the only thing the physician does is sign the application, before this change they had to justify why you were totally and permanently disabled so there could be a reason to deny you) there is a 3 year monitoring period (go to the above websites to read about the specifics). Your loans will be in forbearance while you are in the 3 year monitoring period so no interest will accumulate and no payments will be due.
2. At the end of the 3 years, if you meet the monitoring rules,  your loans are permanently discharged which is considered your formal discharge date (for example: approved application in 2024 means a permanent discharge in 2027).
3. **DESPITE WHAT THE WEBSITE SAYS** (they need to update it) **your discharge will NOT b**e **considered federal taxable income** (some states will still tax it although without a 1099-C I am not sure how they will know that) due to the budget law signed 7/4/25 which included a clause to exclude the discharged amount from being taxable. You will NOT receive a 1099-C. (Also students who die will not get a 1099-C on the remaining amount of their federal loan(s).
4. Note: **the law only explicitly mentioned student federal loans and not parents with federal Parent Plus loans** in that law change and so I am not sure if parents/Parent Plus loans will be included in the implementation of the new law or not. I got conflicting answers when I asked the Federal Student Aid dept, however someone in the comments mentioned they will be included. Also students (again not sure if that will include parents with Parent Plus loans as again the wording of the law only said student) who die with student federal loans will NOT get a 1099-C  so their estate will not pay taxes on any discharged amount. It would appear, but again this needs confirmed, if a parent co-signed a federal student loan and that student died or was declared disabled, satisfied the monitoring, since the loan would be discharged for one of those reason, then the parent wouldn't have to take over the loan and continue to make payments.

6. If your application has not yet been processed and your forbearance is running out call your processor. There was a pause on processing them and they have started up again, however there is a backlog.
7. If you made any federal student loan payments after you submitted your application those payments will be returned to you if your application is approved.

How the Adjustment Works[^(\[2\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment)The IDR account adjustment credits time in repayment, deferment, or forbearance on earlier loans before consolidation toward IDR forgiveness.

Therefore, forgiveness under IDR would typically occur after 20-25 years of qualifying payments on these new loans.[^(\[4\])](https://studentaid.gov/idr/)**How to Check Your Forgiveness Status**If you have questions about your specific payment count or believe you should be closer to forgiveness, I recommend reviewing your payment history and contacting your loan servicer for a detailed breakdown.Would you like more information on how payment counts are calculated, or help with understanding your repayment options?Sources:***This answer is AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies.*** ***Verify important information.*** 11:43 AMYour Loan Status Loan TypeOutstanding PrincipalStatusDirect Consolidated Unsubsidized$18k In Repayment/ForbearanceDirect Consolidated Subsidized $17k In Repayment/Forbearance
   * Under IDR plans, federal student loans are eligible for forgiveness after 20 or 25 years (240 or 300 months) of qualifying monthly payments, depending on the specific plan and whether your loans were for undergraduate or graduate study.[^(\[1\])](https://studentaid.gov/articles/student-loan-forgiveness/)
   * If you started repayment in 2001 and have made qualifying payments consistently, you may be at or near the forgiveness threshold. However, periods of forbearance, deferment, or consolidation can affect your qualifying payment count.[^(\[2\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment)
   * The Department of Education reviews accounts and notifies borrowers who reach the forgiveness threshold. You do not need to apply separately for IDR forgiveness; you will be contacted when eligible.[^(\[2\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment)
   * Forgiven debt through IDR will not be federally taxed if discharged between 01/01/2021 and 01/01/2026, but some states may tax the forgiven amount.[^(\[3\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-court-actions)
   * You will receive notification from your loan servicer and the Department of Education when you reach the forgiveness threshold.
   * You can monitor your qualifying payment count and IDR progress by logging into your account at [StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) and reviewing your loan details.
   * Keep your contact information up to date to ensure you receive notifications.[^(\[4\])](https://studentaid.gov/idr/)

* Borrower/Student: That's not what I was told, I was told loan consolidation would continue from the 2001 date, not the new date



* Aidan: **Next Steps:**Would you like help checking your current payment count or guidance on contacting your loan servicer?Sources:Key PointDetailsConsolidation and Payment Count[^(\[1\])](https://studentaid.gov/articles/5-things-before-consolidating-student-loans/)[^(\[2\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment)If you consolidated your loans before the one-time IDR account adjustment deadline (June 30, 2024), your qualifying payments made before consolidation—including those dating back to 2001—should count toward IDR forgiveness. This is a temporary change from the usual rule, which resets your payment count to zero after consolidation. How the Adjustment Works[^(\[2\])](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment)The IDR account adjustment credits time in repayment, deferment, or forbearance on earlier loans before consolidation toward IDR forgiveness. This means your repayment history prior to consolidation should be included in your qualifying payment count. What to Expect[^(\[5\])](https://studentaid.gov/idr/)The Department of Education is reviewing accounts and updating payment counts. If your pre-consolidation payments qualify, you should see those months credited toward forgiveness. You will be notified by your loan servicer when your account is updated. 
   * If you consolidated after the adjustment deadline, your payment count resets to zero and prior payments do not count.[^(\[1\])](https://studentaid.gov/articles/5-things-before-consolidating-student-loans/)
   * If you consolidated before the deadline, your payment history from 2001 should be credited, and you may be eligible for forgiveness sooner.
   * Check your loan details and payment count by logging into [StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/). Updates from the IDR account adjustment may still be processing for some borrowers.
   * Review your Aid Summary and payment count on [StudentAid.gov](http://StudentAid.gov) to confirm your qualifying payments.
   * If your payment count does not reflect your full history, contact your loan servicer for clarification and request a review.

Reddit,StudentLoans,public service forgiveness,1mug4gn,Will my existing $90k in student loans qualify for PSLF if I work at a nonprofit hospital after getting my BSN?,"Hi everyone, I could use some guidance.

I currently have just under $90,000 in federal student loans, enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan. I’ve just applied to a nearby college to pursue a BSN. The program has a partnership with a not-for-profit hospital that covers most of the tuition, as long as I commit to working for them for 2 years after graduation.

Here’s my question: once I graduate, if I’m working as an RN for that nonprofit hospital, will all of my existing loans (the current $90k in SAVE) qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)? Or would PSLF only apply to any loans I take out to finish the BSN?

I’m trying to get a realistic picture of how this would impact my overall student debt situation before I dive in.

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Additional Context:   
I already have a bachelor’s degree (Business Administration and Marketing) and a master’s degree in Organizational Behavior and Management. I’m pursuing an RN path with a focus on hospice/palliative care, and I eventually plan to advance to an NP role.

So in trying to figure out what my next step is, I checked the the payment number link (https://studentaid.gov/app/api/nslds/payment-counter/summary) and today is the first time it worked for me.

Immediately after the deadline Navient transferred my loan as it was consolidating to mohelia so I don't know if that would've screwed me as well.

Anyway, I guess I'm just wondering what my move is now. ICR shows 79/300 payments remaining. Will that allow me the $0 monthly payments I was getting with IBR?

Currently in the SAVE program in forbearance, BUT interest started accruing as of this month on August 1st. So, now it’s either really make a dent, or pay interest which seems like a waste of money. The best plan I could come up with, was eliminate $74k worth of debt immediately and be left with only two loans at 4.3% and 5.2%. This would leave me with about $40k in my savings and half my debt would be gone. 

I’d also like to add that in my state, we get a $2500/year tax credit when you pay up to $2500/year towards your loans with a cap of $25,000 in lifetime (basically free money when I pay into state taxes, $2500 is knocked off, I think that’s how it works). So definitely something to factor in. Lastly, since these are federal, yes there is potential of them being forgiven in the future, but who knows if and when that’ll happen, so my gut kinda tells me to not even factor that in and just pay them down and be done. 

My last thought is, I could dump this entire amount into VOO or some other fund and get better returns MOST LIKELY, but also not guaranteed and there is some risk there.

I make $82.5k before taxes, which sounds great, but honestly? I hate it. I’m miserable most days and the only thing keeping me semi-afloat are antidepressants. I can’t just leave though — I don’t have a degree and I basically lucked into this role. If I left, I’d never land something like it again.

Today I got a letter from my state attorney general saying there’s a $29k judgment against me for student loans I didn’t even know I had. On top of that, I already owe $67k in loans I’ve known about for years. I’ve been paying around $300 a month, but it barely dents the balance because of interest. Now with this extra $30k, I just feel completely crushed.

The reality is, these weren’t even loans I actively took out. My mom handled everything back when I was a teenager. I didn’t understand what I was signing or what it meant for my future. I just let her do it. I dropped out at the end of my junior year and never graduated. And now here I am, stuck with debt that feels impossible to escape.

I’ve already spent most of my 20s messing up — drugs, toxic relationships, no direction. I was going through severe mental illness on top of all of that. I’d been hospitalized 4 or 5 times and through rehab thankfully through a scholarship program they offered. Thank to them, I finally got sober (2 years now), and am trying to get my life together, landed a good job, and am trying to start saving for the future. For the first time, I was actually hopeful.

Then this letter shows up and I feel like I’ve been knocked all the way back down. I’m angry, I’m defeated, and honestly I don’t even know what to do anymore.

But, I’m starting now which is better than nothing. I’ve been at my new job for less than a year since graduating college. It’s not necessarily where I want to be career-wise but since I don’t pay rent and live with family it helps me save for now. I’ve just been focusing on budgeting and saving. I only make $30k a year. I have a checking, savings, and HYSA. I’d like to go back to school but I have $25k in student loan debt and idk what I want to pursue yet. I’m currently saving up for a car ($11.5/$13k saved so far), but I also want to travel a bit and such. 

But anyways, recently I’ve been wanting to really manage my finances and help myself build a better future. I’ve seen my parents live beyond their means at times and I don’t want financial illiteracy or lack of knowledge set me back. My parents never taught me anything about finances so I’m figuring this all out as I go. I’ve read through the guide on the subreddit and the flow sheet and it’s a lot to take in. 

I never paid anything to anything to do with retirement, investing, etc. Not only were all these things confusing but also just overwhelming. I’d like to open a ROTH IRA today either with Fidelity or Vanguard. But I was also looking at my employer’s 401k. It looks like they have one through Fidelity and they also have a ROTH 401 k. What’s the difference? 
How do I figure out what my employer’s match would be? It looks like in October they’ll re-open it so that I can opt-in to it. But what if I leave the job, what happens to that? 

I work full time right now but considering cutting down my hours to part-time. I feel like I work so much that I can’t even focus on life and next steps. I just wake up and go to work.

I feel guilty for just starting to really learn how to manage my finances and build a future for myself. But, I’m starting now which is better than nothing. I’ve been at my new job for less than a year since graduating college. It’s not necessarily where I want to be career-wise but since I don’t pay rent and live with family it helps me save for now. I’ve just been focusing on budgeting and saving. I only make $30k a year. I have a checking, savings, and HYSA. I’d like to go back to school but I have $25k in student loan debt and idk what I want to pursue yet. I’m currently saving up for a car ($11.5/$13k saved so far), but I also want to travel a bit and such. 

But anyways, recently I’ve been wanting to really manage my finances and help myself build a better future. I’ve seen my parents live beyond their means at times and I don’t want financial illiteracy or lack of knowledge set me back. My parents never taught me anything about finances so I’m figuring this all out as I go. I’ve read through the guide on the subreddit and the flow sheet and it’s a lot to take in. 

I never paid anything to anything to do with retirement, investing, etc. Not only were all these things confusing but also just overwhelming. I’d like to open a ROTH IRA today either with Fidelity or Vanguard. But I was also looking at my employer’s 401k. It looks like they have one through Fidelity and they also have a ROTH 401 k. What’s the difference? 
How do I figure out what my employer’s match would be? It looks like in October they’ll re-open it so that I can opt-in to it. But what if I leave the job, what happens to that? 

I work full time right now but considering cutting down my hours to part-time. I feel like I work so much that I can’t even focus on life and next steps. I just wake up and go to work. I have hobbies and friends but I don’t think I’ve really explored who I am and the life I’m building. I feel like I’m genuinely just existing at times.

Reddit,personalfinance,student loan forgiveness,1n0luvv,Advice for Master’s student,"Hi all!

Looking for advice about how to handle my finances as I go back to school. I’m 28, and I’ve been in the workforce for six years making a comfortable salary. I’m starting school part time and I want to make good decisions with the money I have. Thank you in advance for advice!

Numbers:
Savings - $24,000
Misc investments - $7,000
Retirement - $84,000
Student loans - $18,000
Anticipated total cost of tuition over 3 years - $42,000
No other debt

Questions:
- I qualify to pause my current student loans while in school, should I do this or continue to pay them off? They are a mix of federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized
- I’m assuming that I should avoid taking out new loans for school as long as possible and use savings. My company also has a tuition match of $5k per year that is on hold but I’m hoping will be reinstated soon. Does that sound right to put off new loans as long as possible?
- If yes to the above, at what point should I take loans again. Said otherwise, how much savings should I aim to have on hand? Does the 6 month emergency fund change as a student?
- Should I withdraw my market investments to pay for school, or a better strategy to leave them in place?
- I have already dropped down my retirement savings to be 6% which is matched by my company. Is there any reason I should go lower in favor of paying for school in the short term?
-Any other advice for me?

Appreciate all advice and thoughts! Please be nice I’m fully self funded and just doing my best!

I am also receiving a lump sum loan repayment for $25k this year. 

I might have paid \~$1k for student loan interest but the website is down. 

I opened a 529 for a future kid and $5000 tax deduction w/$5000 contribution on q1/q2 state income tax. 

I also opened an HSA that I intend on maxing out w/ $4300 (however I had an FSA in the beginning of the year that has like $60 on it- side question, does this make me hsa ineligible. Since I'm not contributing to that FSA anymore can I still be reimbursed for spending that occurred prior to opening/contributing to the the HSA?

My 403b/a and Roth IRA are with fidelity and I don't want to roll them over because I want to stay in my investments. The new employer plan is with T Rowe Price and my choices are pretty limited to a TDF. 

I am not sure if I am going to exceed the income limit for Roth or not. It seems like it's going to be close. If I fall in this range with my MAGI I can partially contribute ($150,001 to $165,000) and if over I have to roll it over. What type of plan do I need to roll it over to in that case? Is that something I can open on my own?

I want to max out my contributions and reduce my MAGI, but I'm confused as to what I'm actually being offered, and the backdoor/megaback door thing. 

These are my plan rules and where I'm getting especially confused, especially since it is explained in terms of percent of salary and not the actual limits:

""Employee contribution limits

You may contribute:

* up to 75% in before-tax contributions, subject to IRS salary deferral limits. 
* up to 75% in Roth contributions (contributions made with money that has already been taxed), subject to IRS salary deferral limits. Learn more about after-tax [Roth contributions](https://www.troweprice.com/rps/rws/account/participant/planning/roth-comparison-calculator.otc). 
* up to 75% in after-tax contributions, subject to IRS overall contribution limits. 

**\[I'm  contributing pre tax and after tax in the account, how do I know if it's Roth or not? The pie chart is just broken down into pre tax, after tax, and employer contribution. Isn't** Roth **also after tax? \]**

Note: Before-tax, Roth, and after-tax contributions may not total more than 75% of your pay in whole percentages only. Before-tax and Roth contributions are subject to IRS salary deferral annual limits. After-tax contributions are subject to IRS overall contribution annual limits. 

# Roth contributions

The plan allows you to make Roth contributions. Unlike before-tax contributions, Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars and offer different tax advantages. Depending on your preference, you’ll be able to choose the tax advantages of Roth contributions, before-tax contributions, or both (as long as your combined savings do not exceed plan or IRS limits,). \[again wish these were spelled out for me\]

# In-plan Roth rollovers

Your plan allows in-plan Roth rollovers, which permit you to convert non-Roth amounts to Roth accounts inside your plan instead of rolling over the amounts to a Roth IRA outside your plan. The amount eligible for an in-plan Roth rollover is generally limited to the amount that would otherwise be available as an eligible withdrawal from the plan. Eligibility for withdrawal and withdrawal amount varies depending on the specific rules of your employer’s plan. An in-plan Roth rollover cannot be reversed after the transfer is made. The decision should be made with care and in consultation with your tax professional. [Initiate an in-plan Roth rollover](http://troweprice.com/rps/rws/account/participant/transactions/inplanrothrollover.otc).""

**\^ELI5 could I also set up a separate Roth IRA within T Rowe Price if I end up not going over the limit ($4000 left to contribute for the year) Where does the $70k limit I read somewhere come in? Is my 401k also a Roth IRA or is that what I need to set up? Or a traditional IRA? This is where I got lost. And where to employer contributions cut into contribution limits? What is megaback door and why does it sound so cool? Is that the after tax non Roth and then you make it Roth?  If you had high salary and low COL what would you do to maximize your tax benefited contributions?**

I know there are a bunch of posts here to learn from, but  I've read a bunch, and I'm still confused. I don't have any close friends or family with type of salary I can talk to, and I've been trying to figure it out on my own.

Reddit,personalfinance,student loan forgiveness,1n0325p,"28 and Struggling, Need to Get on Top","I am 28 years old, have a secure full-time job with full benefits, making $30/hr before tax &amp; deductions. I am currently stuck trying to decide how to fix my current financial situation, without screwing up my future any more than I already have.

Here's my situation:

* I have $805.99/mo in consumer debt (credit cards/auto loans/personal line of credit) with varying interest rates from 4.25% on the low end, to 29.99% on the high end.
* I currently pay $1065/mo for my share of rent in a small 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate who has an unstable job situation, that could lose his job and stop paying his share of rent at any time, and we are locked into a lease for another 12 months.
* I have private and federal student loans. Private student loans I have a co-signer who does not make any payments for me, and that payment is $399.93/mo, the federal student loan I'm not even paying due to my current financial strain.
* Other misc. expenses include: internet, water bill, phone bill, fuel, car insurance, storage unit, food budget: $1216/mo.
* Total monthly expenditures: $3485.99/mo
* Total monthly income after deductions &amp; tax: \*roughly depending on 38/40 hrs worked\* $3600/mo

Some of these expenses can vary, such as food/fuel, but the others are generally exactly the same each month. I can get away with just making the minimum payments on my credit cards, but this doesn't get me anywhere at all after interest is piled back on top. I then don't have much, if anything, left over to build upon my tiny savings that I have. Which is around $6000 tied up in stocks/crypto. 

  
So here is my ask for direction, at this point in my life I only see 2 options: 

* Continue making minimum payments to build upon my savings, so that I can save up enough to put down money on a house, potentially saving myself from a nasty fallout with the roommate, along with building equity in a home. (But I see my debt as a roadblock when it comes time to apply for a mortgage.)
* OR use the little savings I have built up through the market and crypto, to wipe my consumer debt slate clean (as much as I can, which means just paying off my credit cards and not my auto loans), to save on my monthly expenditures, and hopefully build back up to the point I'm at now with my savings, (which has taken me 3 years to get to this point). 

I don't want to lose this small nest egg I have built up, and the potential exponential rewards for holding on to these assets as long as I can, but I am losing my mental health and motivation quickly.

They were a surprise and my wife and I definitely want to move to a better school district before they start school in about 4 years (realistically we'd want to move in 3.5 years). The school districts that we do have near us that are affordable have homes that are worth about $50 or $60,000 more than what our house is worth right now. Our house is worth about $330,000 and we owe just over $200,000 on it. 

My wife's student loan debt which totals about $20,000. One loan is about 10% and the other loan is about 14%,, split pretty evenly. We have been paying an extra $500 per month towards tackling that 14% loan and then once that's paid off, avalanchine that whole payment towards the 10% loan. Estimated payoff time is I think 21 months. Besides the mortgage that's the only debt that we have. We put a very large cash payment down for the house so aren't mortgage is only about $1,300 a month.

We bring in cumulatively $160,000 a year and after expenses we have about $3,500 left over at the end of the month combined, which goes into our respective retirement/investment accounts. We have a fully funded emergency fund that we could stretch to about 10 months of expenses if we went bare bones beans and rice, but about 7 months of normal spending. 

I just don't know what I should be doing in the short term to put us at the most advantageous position to buy a more expensive house in such a short turnaround time. Paying off the debt in full? Putting extra towards our mortgage to build more equity? Saving up as much cash as possible in my hysa or ETF? 

My wife puts about $500 a month into her 401k but that's her only retirement vehicle because she makes significantly less than I do.

Reddit,personalfinance,student loan forgiveness,1mzzeus,Inherited IRA vs. Student Loans: A math problem,"TLDR:

-177k student loan, 6.75% federal loan
-186k inherited IRA.
-Self employed with income and expenses basically canceling out at the moment (will be ~40k income this year) 

How would you repay?

The details:

Inherited IRA: 
My uncle recently passed and named me part beneficiary of his 401k which will amount to 186k. I’ll have access to that in about 10 days. This needs to be withdrawn within 10 years. No RMDs.

Student loans: 
I went to school for many years and work in healthcare. I accumulated 177k student loan burden at 6.75%. COVID-related student loan changes had the interest accrual frozen until Aug 1st of this year so that is now back in full swing. 

Current income:
I got very burnt out and started my own business last year so my income/expenses are essentially canceling out at the moment. I likely won’t make more than 40k this year. This could certainly change, but assuming it does not for the purpose of this discussion. I’ve developed a good sense of personal finance since graduating, and do fine with what I’ve got coming in. Not much going into retirement savings at the moment is the biggest downside of self employment right now. 

Current investments/finances:
I am 35 years old and have roughly 50k saved for retirement so far. I do not plan on having kids. 


I am unbelievably grateful to my uncle for naming me a beneficiary and am now facing the challenge of figuring out the best way to repay the loan. 

The question:
The goal is to minimize tax burden on withdrawals while also minimizing interest accrual on the loan. 

I’ve checked with SoFi and am pre-qualified to switch the loan to private, reducing the interest from 6.75% to 5%. 

I’ve basically landed on a couple scenarios with help of friends and good ol AI…but am looking for any guidance or any avenues that I may be missing. 

Scenarios so far 
A) lump some withdrawal -leaves largest amount of student debt remaining due to high tax burden. 
B) 5-6 year payoff plan - complicated and only greatly beneficial if the market keeps up the way it has. Could potentially be awful if it takes a downturn. 
C) 50/50 approach - pulling 50% of the inherited IRA this year, and the rest next year. Leaves me with loan repayment of ~30k if my math is correct. 

Looking to redditors smarter than I am in this department. Is there another scenario I might be missing? Or other investment opportunities I could benefit from with this money - that will in the long run allow me to have some combo of paying off the loan while also saving for retirement?

Anyway at this time, these loans are at \~$190,000 deferred until 6 months after graduation. I don't want my parents paying for this for the rest of their lives, nor can they afford it, so I need to find a way to pay these loans while setting myself up for financial stability and retirement later in life.

1. Should I have my parent refinance all or part of the loans through a private lender under my name when loan rates supposedly drop in September? or should we wait to refinance after I graduate?
2. Should my parent just consolidate all 3 loans and enroll in IDR repayment plans, and I pay my parent after graduation?

There are several factors that led to this point, and I wish I had known earlier, but all we can do now is figure out a plan. Obviously locking down her credit and tight budgeting are immediate action items.  
  
Her income has recently increased to 78k with a FICO hanging on above 700. She also has 30k in student loans (on track for pslf next year, assuming pslf still exists) and a $300/m car lease. Luckily, she has stable employment with upward mobility that's mostly remote so she plans (and will need) to work indefinitely. My sibling and I have been expecting to bear some of the financial responsibility for her retirement, but credit card debt this late in the game was not anticipated.  
  
She already tried to get a personal loan from her credit union but was denied. She tried calling the credit card companies but none offered payment plans because she hasn't missed any payments. She was speaking with a credit settlement company before I got involved; they wanted her to default on all her cards, but she doesn't want to destroy her credit if possible.  
  
She owes 164k @3.5% on her home and we estimate ~140k in equity. I was hoping to preserve this low rate, but that may not be an option. Her current mortgage is a cash out refi she did during covid - Texas laws disqualify her from a HELOC or 2nd mortgage due to her having previously done a cash out refi.  
  
We got estimates for a new cash out refi to wipe out the cards and expect ~7-7.25% which would take her mortgage from $850 to $1650. She would be close to maxing out to 80% LTV to pay off the cards and roll in closing costs. Her roof is 25 years old which means her insurance is expensive (and they keep threatening to drop her), but it sounds like we can't squeeze that in for now.  
  
I'm going to have her contact the NFCC to see if a DMP is possible. Even if it is, I'm expecting that would be upwards of $1600/m since they typically require you to pay it back in 5 years max. I think this would become a cash flow issue.  
  
The only other option we thought of was to pull from her 401k. I estimated she would need to pull 80k to cover the cards plus the income taxes. The devistating problem here is that I found out she only has 85k in her 401k.
  
I think the cash out refi is going to be the only option here. She is reluctant to lock herself into that high of a mortgage, but acknowledges it's better than the other options cash flow wise. 30 day close and she can start moving forward again. The irrational part of me thinks she should just pull it from the 401k to be done with it because there's barely anything in there to begin with; that's just frustration, I know it will keep compounding and should be a last resort.  
  
I've got cash to keep her afloat for a while, but also can't light ourselves on fire trying to keep her warm. Are we dumb for not looking into bankruptcy at this point?

Reddit,personalfinance,PSLF,1mpgcs5,"Small business structure, solo 401k, tax reduction as a new attending physician","I have a fairly complex financial situation and though I try to self-educate via the various articles available here I am wondering if it is worth getting professional advice at least in the short term as I navigate the follow situations:

* I finished residency in 2024. I have 375k in student loan debt and currently am a little more than halfway to PSLF having paid very little thanks to COVID. I should be close to 6 years in but have not had payments count for several months as I've been in a SAVE forbearance and despite attempts to get off of in Oct and Jan am still sitting in SAVE. I will likely try again to get on PAYE in the coming weeks but am hoping that a final ruling on SAVE will occur before that.
* I am employed in a PSLF eligible outpatient job making around 145k, I also run a part-time private practice (sole proprietorship) that is on pace to gross a little over 100k with pretty low overhead. I also do occasional moonlighting at a hospital that will probably gross 40-50k. I have maxed the 401k through my employer. I have been making estimated quarterly payments for the business income and just met with an accountant today to make sure I am handling taxes correctly.
* I filed for a tax extension for 2024 to help reduce loan payments once I am on an IBR plan again.
* I got married in February. My wife just started her attending job and will make about 500k. She is also pursuing PSLF so, without having formally run the numbers, I assume we are best of filing taxes separately.
* I have contributed to a Roth IRA since residency but only found out a couple weeks ago that now that I am married and will file separately will be over the limit and face penalties. I will need to figure out how to fix this.

The accountant I met today was helpful but I think a little out of her depth with some of these needs, particularly with retirement/business structure. She mentioned S-Corp being something I should consider, though from what I recall reading on WCI I'm not sure if it makes sense at this stage or not. I also was thinking maybe I should do a solo 401k to try to lower AGI. I also need to figure out what to do with the Roth (backdoor Roth)?

I know general consensus here is usually to figure this stuff out on our own but right now I am not confident that I can pull all these moves off simultaneously and correctly.

Reddit,personalfinance,PSLF,1mizchy,Considering Balance Transfer After Accumulating CC Debt While Studying for Bar Exam. Advice?,"I graduated law school in the spring, was studying full time for the bar exam (which I took last week), just paid for expenses of moving to a new city, and won’t begin my post-grad job until part way through this September. My post-grad job is a one-year judicial clerkship that will pay roughly $65,000 annually and will be a stepping stone to a future career with the federal government. I plan to take advantage of public service loan forgiveness to have my law school loans forgiven after 10 years of income-based repayment (provided that the PSLF program doesn’t get gutted anytime soon).

Because I’ve been focused on the bar exam, my only income since May has been from occasional gig work and selling off as many possessions as I can. It’s been drops in the bucket. Consequently, I’ve had to rely on my Chase credit card for most expenses. For the first time in my life, I’ve been carrying a balance on my credit card month-to-month and accruing a nasty amount of interest. I should have dealt with this much earlier but was preoccupied with exam study and stupidly put it off.

I just managed to sell a couple valuable items I inherited from my grandparents, and I used the proceeds to pay my credit card debt down from over $9,000 to roughly $5,000. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like the sensible thing to do now would be to do a balance transfer so that the $5,000 debt is on a 0% APR promo rate instead of the ridiculous rate at which it’s accruing interest now.

Chase has been sending me offers for a balance transfer to a checking account (with non-Chase accounts eligible) with a 5% transfer fee and a 0% APR until June. That would give me more than enough time to pay off the $5,000 while handling my other routine expenses. My questions:

1. Will Chase let me balance transfer to my only checking account, which is at PNC, and then use the cash received in my checking account to pay off my Chase card, effectively converting my debt with Chase to 0% APR for the promo period? I’ve read mixed things about this since typically you can’t use a balance transfer offer from a bank to pay off a card also with that bank.

2. Should I just look for a better balance transfer option, like opening a card with somewhere like Citi that has a lower balance transfer fee? My credit score has taken a nose dive since accumulating card debt and is roughly 690. It hasn’t yet registered that I just paid off $4,000 in credit card debt today, which is what took me down to my current $5,000 debt balance.

3. Should I do something altogether different?

Reddit,personalfinance,PSLF,1mfrl7s,"My 2023 Corolla just got flooded in Maryland—here for 3 years, should I lease or buy?","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice.

I recently moved to Maryland for work, and I’ll only be here for about 3 years before moving back to Louisiana. My 2023 Toyota Corolla just got flooded here in Maryland. I had it for 2 years, was paying $559/month, and now I’m waiting to see what my insurance will cover.

Some details about me:

* Income: about $70,000/year
* Rent: $1,300/month
* Savings: around $15,000
* Student loans: haven’t been paying yet because of the PSLF program
* My old car: 2023 Corolla, $559/month payment, insurance was $347.16/month
* Biggest expense outside of rent was the car + insurance
* I know nothing about cars and really don’t want to deal with selling a car, title transfers, or moving a car across states when I leave.
* I feel like I already wasted 2 years of car payments, and the idea of “throwing money away” on a lease worries me—but honestly, I kind of feel like I wasted money anyway since the car flooded.

Since I’ll only be here for 3 years, what’s the smartest move?

* Lease a car (seems easier and predictable, but is it really a waste?)
* Buy new or used, and then deal with selling/moving later?

If anyone can break down the pros and cons of leasing vs buying (new or used) for someone in my situation, I’d appreciate it.

Due to the Covid payment pause and now the SAVE forbearance, there have been very few months since then that I have been required to make a payment, so I've been saving the money instead. I used my AmeriCorps Segal education award to bring my loan balance down to about $3k in 2023.

Good morning all,

I work for a Federal Govt Agency that offers an annuity after 5+ years of service. I just completed my fifth year, and I am looking to exit the public sector and get a non-govt job to increase my pay. The only question I have in doing this, is what I should do with my Annuity contributions.

My agency has taken out 4.4% of every paycheck I've had since I began my career. Doing the math, that amount comes out to a total of about $18k before taxes. If I left the service and never came back, I would receive roughly $4.4k in today's dollars yearly in retirement in the form of an Annuity. Its chump change for sure, but the fact that it's an annuity makes this situation unique and I'm not sure what to do with it. I can cash it out when I leave and take the lump sum of my contributions (18k) and roll that into my 401k, or I could pocket it and add it to my savings for a house, OR I could keep it and enjoy the extra play money in retirement. 

Any recommendations or thoughts? I am 27 if that helps so certainly still early career. I don't anticipate I'd want to return to the govt, but I am not excluding that from my options down the line.",1755787767.0,2025-08-21 07:49:27,/r/personalfinance/comments/1mwd2rm/should_i_27_cash_out_my_annuity_with_my_employer/,Scorch8482,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mwd2rm/should_i_27_cash_out_my_annuity_with_my_employer/,5.0,0.86,8.0,False,self.personalfinance,True,"Should I [27] cash out my Annuity with my employer after only 5 years? #

Reddit,personalfinance,public service forgiveness,1mr13t4,2008 Account Lost and Transferred Multiple Times 401k 403(b),"Hello,

We are not financial gurus. We work public service jobs and we live a modest life.

One thing that came up for us that this community may be able to provide further information in regards to.

My mother is a nurse. She contributed money to a Columbia Presbyterian Hospital 403(b) Plan account up until 2008. This specific account moved around a few times and today we finally found the account. We tracked it down from 2008.

2008 - Prudential sent a check to Diversified Investment Advisors (now TransAmerica)for $9500. 

2019 - TransAmerica sent back the account to Prudential

2020 - Prudential sent account to Empower

2025 - Empower found the $9500

My question is that this $9500 should have been invested unless I am missing something. Why hasn't it appreciated? They said they can send a check for $9500.

Shouldn't this have appreciated? Also, isn't the point of having this money in their account for them to manage it? Aren't there management costs associated with this?

Any tips or guidance will be appreciated. We are happy they are able to send the original $9500 back. But I don't want her to lose money that should have appreciated.

Thanks!!

Reddit,personalfinance,public service forgiveness,1mjv9jq,Seeking Advice - Rollover Old 401k to New Company or Convert to Self-Directed Roth,"Hello, I’m a 25M (based in California) who is seeking advice on whether to rollover my 401k from my old employer to my new firm or to convert the funds to my Roth.

Background: I recently switched jobs in July and got a large raise from $91.5k/yr to $110k/yr - I also switched from non-exempt to exempt which stabilized my earnings going from hourly to salary. Based on my earnings to date and forecasting the rest of the year I’ll make roughly $105.3k in 2025. 

I currently hold $26.5k in my Roth and $26k in my 401k and as it stands my Federal Tax Bracket (marginal rate) is 22%, effective tax rate is ~16%, and California Tax Bracket is 9.3%. My deductions are ~$4.5k in 401k contributions (old employer and projected contributions rest of the year) and I have ~$380 in student loan interest expense. I have also calculated my expected total taxes paid to the Fed to be ~$13.65k, for California I’ve yet to calculate what I’ll pay but I expect it to be ~$5k.

Lastly, I currently live at home and pay my Dad $1k a month in rent (for the roof, food, etc.) and I own my car outright. In terms of debt I have $12.7k in student loans at rates between 2.25% - 3.23% and roughly $11k in credit card debt (of which I am soon consolidating $10k onto one of my cards which offered 1 year of 0% APR) and I owe my friend $1.2k which bears no interest and there’s no rush in repaying him. I will be coming into roughly $2.8k within the next month from a security deposit being returned and my girlfriend paying me back for a trip we took which I intend to put towards servicing my credit card debt.

With respect to my investing I’ve been doing so since I was 16 (used the proceeds to buy my car and pay for a good portion of college) and I have a rather large risk tolerance but like to think I maintain a good balance. Within my Roth I currently have roughly 55% in blue chips like $MSFT $AMZN $GOOG $AXP, 5% in REITs like $VICI, and 40% in $ASTS (this is due to buying a little more than 200 shares cheaply before it skyrocketed over the past year). I’m also familiar with options and have made a fair amount within my Roth selling Covered Calls on my $ASTS stock. Should I make the 401k to Roth conversion I would put the bulk of it into one of the S&amp;P 500 ETFs or a Technology ETF and the rest into individual tickers.

Given the context above is out of the way, I’m debating if I should choose to make the conversion from my old 401k to my Roth and whether it makes sense in the long run. In the short-term in 2025 the conversion would push my income to $131.3k and I will push myself into the 24% Federal Tax Bracket and be significantly underpaid on taxes (as of today) by roughly ~$5.7k for Fed and I’m unsure about California but my best guess is another $1-$1.5k (one thing to note is that for the past 3 years I tended to be heavily overpaid for State taxes due to the large amount of overtime so I don’t think this would be as hard to swallow as the additional federal tax bill).

From research and using online calculators it seems like the long-term benefits significantly outweigh the costs in the short-term in terms of the tax-free growth and earnings but I’d love to heard other input from others on whether it will make that much of a difference in my future draws.

Apologies for the long-winded post and any formatting errors, I tried to provide as much information as possible and I’m on mobile. It’s also hilarious to me that I’m asking this since I’m a CPA working in Public Accounting. Any advice is appreciated and I appreciate your time. Thanks!

Reddit,personalfinance,public service forgiveness,1mdzmsl,Leaving Alliant Credit Union - Thoughts on these alternatives?,"Hey all,

I am disappointed in Alliant for falling short and stripping away all of its advantages. Its savings account has been subpart for awhile. I was willing to forgive that, since I keep the majority of my emergency fund in 0-3 month treasury bond ETFs. But now that they are nerfing the flat cashback card from 2.5% to 1.6%, I see no reason to stay with them.

My criteria is pretty simple: I am looking for an online bank/CU with good savings and/or money market rates, user-friendly online banking experience, ATM fee reimbursement (to cover at least 1 fee per month, but 2 would be ideal), and decent customer service.

I am considering the following credit unions and banks:

**HUSTL Credit Union:** Amazing money market rate, plus the savings and checking rates are also good. It is a pretty new Credit Union (or rather, division of Vantage West Credit Union). I don't know much about the institution otherwise, and I haven't been able to get much information on how consistent they are likely to be with these rates. But, they app looks like it is user friendly and tech-forward.

**Wealthfront:** Amazing rates, opportunities to boost rates, ATM reimbursement

**Synchrony:** Pretty similar reason to Wealthfront. Any thoughts on which may be more user-friendly?

**Ally:** Decent rates, reimbursement, and the bonus looks fantastic. I think Ally is more well-established and consistent that Wealthfront and Synchrony, but I may be wrong. I should be able to achieve the SUB pretty easily.

Right now, I am not interested in SOFI. My main reason being something that would make SOFI worthwhile is achieving the SUB, but with everything taken out of my paycheck, the math will not math for me to achieve the $300 SUB.

Reddit,personalfinance,public service forgiveness,1m6qepw,Should i take out a loan for my first car,"I (21F) just graduated with a bachelors degree where my almost my entire education was paid by FASFA &amp; TAP. Coming out of college i’m only 4500$ in debt which isn’t too bad. i want to start my masters career this august, where i will be pursuing a double masters in social welfare and criminal justice. i got some assistance so i will only have to take out 4000$ a semester. if tuition rates stay more or less the same i will graduate with 2 master degrees with only 24,000$ in debt which i don’t have to start repaying untill jan 2029. My end goal is to do something with with law and public service so i know that i will be eligible for the PSLF thingy if the requirements more less stays the same. 

so now that you have a A little background of my financial situation. i want to take 8k out so i can purchase a reliable car that will help me commute to work along with school. I know a car comes with numerous expenses but i already plan to make uber/doordash accounts to have some extra pocket change on top of my bills. i would only use MAX 5k for the car and the 3k remaining to help with moving to my new apartment where my grad school is. 

With that in mind do we think getting a car now is ideal? it would definitely help me out so much especially in terms of moving. i’ve used public transportation for my entire life prior to this. 


Edit: after reading some comments i wanted to clarify some things. my dual degree is split into 3 semesters each. so my entire first year and the first semester of my 2nd year will be Social work. the remaining 3 semesters will be Criminal Justice. So by May 2028 i will be completely done with both degrees. I have class for only 2 days out of the week. the other 2 days i would work im my field position (this counting as “class” and a source of income) and on the weekends i work abt 25-30hrs (which isn’t full time alone but with the hours at field work i will be doing 40 or so within the week)

Coming out of college i’m only 4500$ in debt which isn’t too bad. i want to start my masters career this august, where i will be pursuing a double masters in social welfare and criminal justice. i got some assistance so i will only have to take out 4000$ a semester. if tuition rates stay more or less the same i will graduate with 2 master degrees with only 24,000$ in debt which i don’t have to start repaying untill jan 2029. My end goal is to do something with with law and public service so i know that i will be eligible for the PSLF thingy if the requirements more less stays the same. 

so now that you have a A little background of my financial situation. i want to take 8k out so i can purchase a reliable car that will help me commute to work along with school. I know a car comes with numerous expenses but i already plan to make uber/doordash accounts to have some extra pocket change on top of my bills. i would only use MAX 5k for the car and the 3k remaining to help with moving to my new apartment where my grad school is. 

With that in mind do we think getting a car now is ideal? it would definitely help me out so much especially in terms of moving. i’ve used public transportation for my entire life prior to this. 


Edit: after reading some comments i wanted to clarify some things. my dual degree is split into 3 semesters each. so my entire first year and the first semester of my 2nd year will be Social work. the remaining 3 semesters will be Criminal Justice. So by May 2028 i will be completely done with both degrees. I have class for only 2 days out of the week. the other 2 days i would work im my field position (this counting as “class” and a source of income) and on the weekends i work abt 25-30hrs (which isn’t full time alone but with the hours at field work i will be doing 40 or so within the week)

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1n0z2bf,Am I in too much debt,"Just a little background info, I’m 20 years old with a wife and child. I’ve recently taken out a loan and a line of credit, as well as a credit card with my bank TD. I also have another credit card with Triangle (The Canadian Tire one) we currently live in a three bedroom townhouse that we split rent with my mother so we pay maybe 300 each a month as rent here is $1200. 

I was wondering if I put myself in a bad spot, my monthly expenses add upto $1136 altogether (groceries, rent, and phone bill) and after adding up all of my current debts I have I owe $10,375 to TD and CT Bank. I work as a plumbers apprentice and make $40,000 a year, and with all of the side projects and weekend gigs that i get paid for in cash I make somewhere in between $48,000 and $60,000 annually. I’ve only just started getting into trying to build a credit history so I may someday buy a house, car, etc. I think i got lucky as the highest interest rate on any of these is 14% on my td line of credit.


The reason why I’ve accumulated this much debt is so that I can pay for a good chunk of the tools that you need as a plumber, aside from the $20,000 drain cleaning machines and $5,000 Propress tools I’ve got everything I need for service plumbing, rough-ins and new construction plumbing (Hand tools, most power tools needed different tasks, wirsbo expander, etc) I’ve also bought a couple of other things from Milwaukee vacuums, floodlights and stocked up on different blades and all kinds of drill bits. 
My thought process was that my tools will make my money back after some time and that i’ll eventually be able to go to school for my license, I haven’t been able to go to do having the baby and things were tight while we had our own apartment ($1800 for a two bedroom) 

After making some payments I’ve realized it takes a good chunk of change, but not too much for me too handle, I was wondering what would be the best route to pay this off and have an emergency fund?
I hope this is the right place to post and ask for questions, i’m not in a desperate situation currently but I have crossed into 5 digits worth of debt and I’m wondering what the best way to go about paying this off is.

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1n0fsgf,Collections - Do their mistakes work in my favor?,"Located in MN, USA.

I need some help to determine if I actually have some legal ground to stand on, or if I should just take their settlement offer. I tried to keep it brief and to the main points, but with so many inaccuracies and inconsistencies it’s hard to parse out what’s actually useful or not. (I'm also insane and have recorded every small inaccuracy and/or inconsistency, this is just some of them haha). I’m disputing a personal loan Bounce AI claims they bought from a Tally Technologies line of credit. My goal is to invalidate the dbet and prevent it from being reported or pursued further, and remove the negative marks on my credit report from SST (and Bounce when/if they show up). 

Background: I opened an account (line of credit) with Tally in February 2022. Tally ceased operations in Sept 2024 and my account transferred to SST shortly after. Per my contract with Tally, if my account ever changed servicers, my balance would become fixed at the current APR, and I’d be set up on a payment plan to fully amortize the balance over 5 years. While my account was with Tally it never appeared on any credit reports/credit bureaus.

While with SST, I made two payments (Oct/Nov 2024). I refused to make others as I did not trust them/their website to keep my info safe, and because my payments were not showing a decrease in account balance – they were being applied to interest only. SST also called me so much that I had to block their number just to get through my work day uninterrupted. I emailed them once saying I didn't trust their website, and 2 other times to request they stop calling me. SST began reporting the account to credit bureaus as SST/Tally in February 2025.

SST continued to send me monthly statements up until April 24, 2025 (some were addressed to a home I moved out of in 2023, some were addressed to my current address). I received a letter from SST dated May 6, 2025, stating “your Tally Technologies loan ID ""loan ID #"" serviced by Systems &amp; Services Technologies, Inc. was sold to **Bounce AI, Inc.** on **04/30/2025** with a balance of **$0.00** and Tally Technologies will no longer have a relationship with you and this loan. This loan was charged off by T**ally Technologies** on **11/18/2024** with a balance of **$0.00** as of that date.” (This was obviously an error, but that’s not my problem). I did not respond to this letter.

On May 15, 2025, I received a letter from Bounce stating that I “had a Personal Loan with Tally…that was sold on **5/15/2025** to Bounce AI”. The letter also provided repayment options, a link to copies of ""original"" account documents via their portal (including a confusing &amp; inaccurate transaction record, Tally Statements, 2 documents - one titled ""Line of Credit Agreement"" and the other ""Loan Agreement"" which are the same document), and information on how to dispute it. I immediately disputed with Bounce that same day. 

On May 22, I received another letter from SST now claiming that it was “…sold to **Bounce AI, Inc.** on **05/02/2025**\-with a balance of **$5,565.36**… this loan was charged off by Tally Technologies on **04/30/2025** with a balance of $5565.36 as of that date…”.

Bounce contacted me via email 4 times after submitting my dispute, urging me to set up a payment plan before a negative listing on my credit report. Bounce offers two repayment options: 12 monthly payments of $440+, or a discounted lump sum of $4,XXX. I finally submitted a complaint to CFPB on June 25, 2025. Bounce responded to both my dispute and complaint on July 9, 2025 and July 14, 2025, respectively. They provided the same files that are in their portal which are insufficient in validating this. Bounce is again claiming that their files validate the account, however, these files contain conflicting, inaccurate, and incomplete information inherited from SST. I never signed anything with SST or Bounce. Bounce is threatening to report a negative mark to the credit bureaus in 5 days.

Key issues: contradictory charge-off letters, collection &amp; communication activity after my written dispute, inconsistent reporting dates/balances; lack of chain of custody; failure to provide full validation; misrepresentation of account type (line of credit vs personal loan); lack of itemized transaction history; how can SST/Bounce claim they bought it from Tally after Tally’s closure?

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1n0bx1r,Bank closed my Solo 401k account. Now what?,"This is part rant and part advice-seeking:

I started a self-directed solo 401K, got the trust and docs drafted by a company called QPS, and then opened an account for the solo 401K at Titan Bank. (Don't use them.)

Part of the appeal for me was being able to invest in weird stuff (stuff that is good for the world) that may not be publicly traded.

I used funds in the account to invest in a couple of microlending organizations. I had maybe max $5,000 I had invested, and I left $86 in the account.

At some point I realized I couldn't log into my Titan Bank Solo 401k account because they closed it without any warning. They said I had a low balance (below $500 they say is low), for which they take a $15 penalty monthly, so they drained my account and when it got to 0 they immediately closed it.

Now that I have (1) put funds into my solo 401k and reported that investment to the IRS, and (2) invested funds from my solo 401k in the form of micro-loans, wtf am I supposed to do?  I have occassionally earned income that should go into my non-existent account. And I can't liquidate the assets to roll them over because most of the funds are tied up for a couple years

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1mxfdrr,How do I plan for being responsible with my personal finance options?,"I am currently 22 years old and working two jobs: one part-time and one full-time, and just looking to find ways to make sure that my finances stay sustainable for retiring at 60. 

Right now, I have these criteria and am wondering where I can go from here. 

Salary: I make around $4888.79 USD as gross-income as a baseline from two jobs. Both of these jobs are hourly - Job A is paid weekly, Job B is paid bi-monthly, so it can fluctuate more or less. Job A doesn't offer PTO, so I alway take at least two weeks off with notice, leading to 50 weeks total worth of pay at minimum. Job B does offer PTO so around 52 weeks. I work 40 hours on Job B and 24 hours on Job A. 

Credit Card/Debt: I currently carry no balance this month on Credit Card C and have roughly 2.5k on Credit Card D. I pay off the entire balance on C every month, while D is partially paid off with balance remaining. Issue is that C is roughly 3 years in service now while D is around 12-13 years in service and is co-signed on my parents credit cards, and I don't want to get rid of it due to my credit score being around 730-740 from it for a relatively few stable years. 

Student Loans: I have roughly $14k USD in 4 separate loans that I've been paying off diligently. These loans are 3 subsidized loans and 1 unsubsidized, with an APR between 3.3% on the lowest end and 5% on the highest end. I plan to pay it off within the time span that I have my current job, so around 41 months to build an established loan history, but not too long that I have to pay it off terminally.

Checking Account: This is probably where I fucked up the most, but I currently have 15k USD in my checking account A and around 3K in another checking account B, which are just sitting there. I do not want to touch Checking Account A, as that is where Job A's salary goes to, and Checking Account B; however, I'm willing to take all the risk to go elsewhere since that is where Job B comes from.

Saving Account: Only have one savings account with $125.44 USD in it, so interest rates are keeping up with the rate of inflation /s That being said, I am open to a HYSA or in this option spend it on a money-market fund in case I need to have access to it. 

Living Expenses: Living expenses are slim to minimal for me. I only have to pay for internet, credit card, and since I'm still living with my parents, I don't need to spend or go out as much. Most of my living expenses go toward my investment.

Brokerage: I currently have investments in FMAG, FTEC, ONEQ, and VXUS as some closed-ended ETFs as well as FSKAX, FSPTX, and FXAIX.

Roth IRA: Currently only has holdings in FMAG and FSPTX.

401K Job A: Currently, I have started to only invest in my initial company since 2025 due to TIS eligibility, and have put in 10% currently going in both ROTH and Traditional 401K since then. Went for a more conservative approach, and all of them are going into TRRLX.

401K Job B: Got 401K situated right as I just got started on it, have put in 10% currently going in both ROTH and Traditional 401K since then. Currently, I am going for a more aggressive/moderate approach for all of them are going into TRSGX.

Cryptocurrency: Probably my biggest regret, but I currently have $1K USD within the account and haven't put any funds in since 2023, but got a moderate return on it.

Goal: As shitty as the US Housing market is, ideally, I'd want to buy a house and then use it for real estate purposes or temporary living spaces as soon as I can get a few remote jobs going. I plan on going to a major metropolitan city by 2030, which is close to Job B, so that I can go ahead and buy that first home. I also want to save for retirement age, roughly at 60 if plausible. I also want to maintain a lower-middle-class stable lifestyle as well; however, I know that there come challenges in that department alone as well.

Brokerage: I currently have investments in FMAG, FTEC, ONEQ, and VXUS as some closed-ended ETFs as well as FSKAX, FSPTX, and FXAIX.

Roth IRA: Currently only has holdings in FMAG and FSPTX.

401K Job A: Currently, I have started to only invest in my initial company since 2025 due to TIS eligibility, and have put in 10% currently going in both ROTH and Traditional 401K since then. Went for a more conservative approach, and all of them are going into TRRLX.

401K Job B: Got 401K situated right as I just got started on it, have put in 10% currently going in both ROTH and Traditional 401K since then. Currently, I am going for a more aggressive/moderate approach for all of them are going into TRSGX.

Cryptocurrency: Probably my biggest regret, but I currently have $1K USD within the account and haven't put any funds in since 2023, but got a moderate return on it.

Goal: As shitty as the US Housing market is, ideally, I'd want to buy a house and then use it for real estate purposes or temporary living spaces as soon as I can get a few remote jobs going. I plan on going to a major metropolitan city by 2030, which is close to Job B, so that I can go ahead and buy that first home. I also want to save for retirement age, roughly at 60 if plausible. I also want to maintain a lower-middle-class stable lifestyle as well; however, I know that there come challenges in that department alone as well. ",,,,

I purchased a home in March of 2023. The purchase price was $325,500. The original appraisal came in high at $338,000. We put 5% down with a 15 year conventional mortgage.

I'd happily drop $5K today to eliminate PMI, but not if they require a new appraisal. How do I figure out whether they will let me skip a new appraisal before I pay the extra $5K?

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1mwhzsw,Trying to Stop Gambling / Impulse Buying and Rebuild My Finances – Advice on Budgeting?,"Hello Reddit friends,

I’m 36 Male, living in Australia, and have been gambling heavily on and off for the past 18 years. I work full-time, but at this stage I have no savings, no investments, and only my superannuation.

For most of my adult life, I’ve had loans—both large and small payday loans—which I would use to gamble. Often, I would take out multiple loans at once, with weekly repayments over $500, and gamble all the money immediately. I’ve also been an impulsive buyer, often using services like Afterpay or PayPal in 4 to buy gadgets I wanted immediately, only to sell them a few days later at a loss to gamble with the cash.

Recently, watching friends and peers buy cars with cash, save for houses, and go on holidays has made me realize I want to change. I’m over never having any money, working 40+ hours a week and having nothing to show for it. At times, I can’t even buy food or go out for breakfast with a friend because I’m poor until next payday—which feels ridiculous given my income and how small my actual needs are. I’m in this position despite not paying rent or a mortgage, as my parents bought the unit for me when I was 20; I only cover strata, rates, and bills. I want to stop gambling, get ahead financially, and break this cycle.

This time, I’m taking more steps:

* I’ve signed up for BetStop, self-excluding from all online wagering in Australia.
* I’ve placed a credit freeze with Illion, Experian, and Equifax to prevent myself from applying for loans or new credit.
* I’ve closed all but one bank account, and my best friend is holding my card.
* I’ve self-excluded from local gambling venues.
* I’ve contacted crypto payment processors (Banxa and MoonPay) to block my accounts.
* For impulsive buying, I’m trying a 48-hour wait rule and consulting friends before making purchases.
* I’m surrounding myself online with gambling support communities, learning from others who have been in this situation, and exploring the option of speaking with a counselor as well.

Now, regarding my finances:

* I owe my dad $7,150 (he’s fine with $50/week, but I want to pay it off faster).
* I have a CommBank Neo card maxed at $1,000 (paying $15/month fee, never use it).
* I have a CommBank personal loan at 11% interest, balance $16,700 (all from gambling).

**Weekly income and expenses:**

* Income: $1,286.12
* Electricity: $30
* Strata: $80
* Water: $15
* Internet/Phone: $55
* Mum’s internet/phone: $24
* Council Rates: $30
* Groceries: $125
* Personal spending: $200 (mostly food/misc; not sure if too high)
* CommBank: $133.25/week ($533/month minimum)
* Dad: $50/week
* PlayStation Plus: $22/month (\~$5/week)
* iPhone AppleCare: $15.99/month (\~$4/week)

Leftover: \~$535/week

I’ll be starting this budget in two weeks. Next week, I’ll pay off an $800 loan, then catch up on strata over two weeks, and then the above budget will kick in.

**My main question:** With the leftover $535/week, should I throw it all toward my dad to get that debt gone faster, or divide it into an emergency fund, savings, and “fun money”? I’ve read that throwing everything at debt can backfire if I get frustrated and want to gamble or buy something impulsively.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post.

Reddit,personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,1mwftev,Charged-off auto loan: Settlement ($20k) vs Full Payment ($33k) - Will the difference really matter in 7 years?,"**TL;DR:** Auto loan charged off, owe $33k. Lender offers $20k settlement or full payment. Neither removes the charged-off status. Is paying extra $13k worth it for ""Paid in Full"" vs ""Settled"" notation?

**The Situation:**

* 2023 auto loan with high interest (24% - yes, I know...)
* Already paid \~$20k (mostly interest)
* Current balance: $33,400
* Car was repossessed, account charged off
* Lender refuses pay-for-delete (tried multiple times)

**My Options:**

1. **Settlement:** $20,039 - Will show ""Settled for less than full balance""
2. **Full Payment:** $33,400 - Will show ""Paid in Full"" but still with charged-off status

**Neither option removes the charged-off mark from credit reports. I'm guessing it's because once it's charged off removing the mark completely is not eligible at this point.**

**What I've Done:**

* Negotiated with lender (Upstart/servicer) - Pay-for-delete is absolutely not possible
* Consulted multiple banks - all refused to give advice citing legal reasons
* One bank employee (off the record) said since I can't remove the charge-off anyway, might as well minimize damage with full payment
* Parents (Korean, different credit system) say both will be irrelevant over time, save the $13k
* Friends are 50/50 split on this

**My Concerns:** Will ""Settled"" vs ""Paid in Full"" on a charged-off account actually affect:

* Future employment (especially in tech/finance/govt/non profit etc)?
* Getting an apartment lease?
* Auto loans in 2-3 years?
* Mortgage in 5-7 years?
* Credit card approvals?

**My Thinking:** The FICO score impact seems similar for both (100-140 point drop), lasting 7 years regardless. The only difference is the notation. Is that notation worth $13,400?

**Questions:**

1. Anyone been through this? How did ""Settled"" vs ""Paid"" actually affect your life?
2. Did employers care? Did landlords care?
3. How long until it became irrelevant?
4. Looking back, do you wish you'd saved the money or paid in full?
5. Is this as big a deal as it feels right now, or am I overthinking?

Howdy there. 

I've been in pretty difficult financial situations - mostly of my own making - for a long time and I'm committed to trying to get out of it.

Some background about me. I'm 41, not married, no kids. No Bachelors degree, but have an associates in Accounting. Have a good amount of upper division coursework under my belt, but still at least an intense two or three semesters to finish.

Currently, I work in the accounting field in something decently niche. I'm hourly, $31.00. My company was recently acquired, so some of the benefits will be changing. I'm not currently concerned with being laid off, but obviously any acquirement comes with that risk.

I have a roommate who is disabled. I provide some care giving but this is unpaid - they do have a paid worker that is covered by Medicaid.

I contribute to an FSA. My net pay per pay period is $1900.00, so my monthly income is $3,800.00

Here's a quick and dirty breakdown of monthly expenses

Rent - $1,500.00

Electric - $65.00 average

Cellphone - $228.81 (two data plans, me and roommate, no phone payments)

Renters Insurance - $33.02

Auto Insurance - $36.00

Loan - $425.00

Storage Units - $531.00

Gas - $240.00

Restitution Payment - $250.00

Credit Card - $25.00

Streaming Services - $77.00


This leaves my net for discretionary spending at $100.00 per week. This is mostly allocated towards groceries.

Currently, I'm behind on storage. It was due today, but I don't have the funds for it.
I won't have the funds in week when I'm paid, as I need to pay rent.

I can't refinance the loan. It has a very bad interest rate, so I would love to do that but I can't.
There is a credit card that is not in use, but has a $300.00 balance.
I have student loans, currently on deferment. I maxed my student loans, so it's about $80,000 in loans.
I currently owe someone $300.00 and I'm going to pay them back mid September.
I have not paid the restitution for the month, and I owe my roommate $170.00 for household purchases.

It's not a great situation.
I've looked at other income sources, but because of the care giving I don't have a lot of hours I can spend towards it. My skill set for gig work is mostly tax prep and bookkeeping, and summer is not a good time of year for that.

As far as cutting expenses, I could get condense the storage to one unit, but I can't get rid of it, as I have an agreement to pay for the storage as part of the restitution payment.

I could roll back some of the streaming services, but they are mainly for my roommate to use and it would be difficult to eliminate all of them.

I could look into a different plan - currently on Verizon, this seems like the most realistic option.
Currently, I'm on a low income program for car insurance. that will end in February, and I'll go back to normal $100 or higher rates.

Currently, just to get ""back on track"" for the month I would need enough money to cover the storage unit, the restitution and the roommate money. Getting $1,000 dollars in two weeks isn't' realistic.

My situation is bad but perhaps not ""dire"". No one is starving or going homeless, but it's very bad for any long term financial goals.

I know ultimately I just need to cut a lot of these useless expenses out, sacrifices must be made, but any specific advice would be well utilized.",1755714162.0,2025-08-20 11:22:42,/r/personalfinance/comments/1mvmvj8/seeking_advice_or_perhaps_unknown_resources_on_my/,Rhycore,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mvmvj8/seeking_advice_or_perhaps_unknown_resources_on_my/,1.0,1.0,4.0,False,self.personalfinance,True,"Seeking advice, or perhaps unknown resources on my situation

Currently, just to get ""back on track"" for the month I would need enough money to cover the storage unit, the restitution and the roommate money. Getting $1,000 dollars in two weeks isn't' realistic.

My situation is bad but perhaps not ""dire"". No one is starving or going homeless, but it's very bad for any long term financial goals.

I know ultimately I just need to cut a lot of these useless expenses out, sacrifices must be made, but any specific advice would be well utilized.",,,,

I pay $600/month in rent, $100/month for car insurance, and about $500/month in groceries (shopping for two). My monthly loans (paying the bare minimum, really) are $397/month.

Reddit,personalfinance,"""Public Service Loan Forgiveness""",1l1oawz,"33, pharmacist, just started investing. Am I doing it right?","Hi all,

I'm a 33 year old pharmacist who would like some extra insight. 

I've worked as a pharmacist for 6 years. My employer offers a 4% pension and 2% (~$125 per two weeks paycheck) match for a 403B tax sheltered annuity. My contributions for the 403B plan are 12% pre-tax (~$709 per two weeks) and 3% post tax (~$175 per two weeks). 

403B balance is at $85,519. The pension is at $29,675. No other retirement accounts. No property owned.

I make about 153k a year currently with 3% annual raises, bringing in about $74 an hour. After my insurance contributions, and taxes i bring home about $3200 net per two week paycheck (so about $6900 a month).

Monthly expenses
Rent (2 locations) $1775/month
Gas ~$300 per month (travel for work mostly)
Utilities ~$100
Food ~$1000/month
Miscellaneous other bills ~$200 per month
Hobbies/Travel/Shopping ~$1000 per month
Student loan payments ~$770 per month - likely to increase considerably and currently in administrative forebarance. 

I'm pursuing public service loan forgiveness on a student loan balance of $177K. Currently stuck in the Save forbearance hell so unable to make progress.

I previously had my retirement contributions increasing proportional to my annual raises so I would never see the raise and feel it's affects while still contributing. Honestly I thought I was skimping out on it but realized this year that my next increase in contributions was going to exceed the max for my 403B 😅 ive left it just under that max to not have any tax issues.

I had 100k as of last month in my measly savings account accruing almost no interest (was saving for a down payment on a house). I decided with the loan forgiveness uncertainty I should put the house purchase idea on hold and instead invest my money. Put 80K into a HYSA and the other 20K into a ""CIO MODERSTE ETF CORE TA"" account with Merrill lynch for investing. I also set to contribute 400 dollars every month to the investment account and plan to push an additional 1k to the HYSA regularly (likely quarterly).

I think I'm doing the right thing overall to hopefully retire by 60 (or even earlier). Considering doing a backdoor Roth IRA. I dont think I qualify for a standard Roth due to income (though not sure if the 150k limit is affected by other contributions to other plans or if theres ways to ""reduce"" my income to still qualify).

I live pretty comfortably and dont have great impulse control 😅. I'm also big on helping friends financially so like to have some extra to help people in need. The 1k in hobbies per month can obviously vary. Sometimes it's nothing, sometimesoit's more. No plans to ever have kids. Some day plan to marry and buy a home but currently single.

Reddit,personalfinance,"""Public Service Loan Forgiveness""",1kx44cv,Considering home refinance to pay off debt,"Hi! 

My husband and I recently financed an AC unit after our 15 year old unit bit the dust. We finance a $12,000 unit for 15 years, 9.99% interest with a monthly payment of $138. 

This purchase got us thinking about doing and a HELOC to pay the unit off as well as some other debts. We have a $2,000 credit card and about $2,300 left on a car loan that we’d also take care of with the HELOC. The loan we were looking at from a soft credit pull with GoodLeap was for $40,000  with a 9.25% interest which would leave us around $24,000 for home improvements after paying off those debts. 

However, today I wanted to compare our options so I called my mortgage company (freedom mortgage) to see what they would offer for a HELOC, hoping for a lower interest rate.

My husband and I recently financed an AC unit after our 15 year old unit bit the dust. We finance a $12,000 unit for 15 years, 9.99% interest with a monthly payment of $138. 

This purchase got us thinking about doing and a HELOC to pay the unit off as well as some other debts. We have a $2,000 credit card and about $2,300 left on a car loan that we’d also take care of with the HELOC. The loan we were looking at from a soft credit pull with GoodLeap was for $40,000  with a 9.25% interest which would leave us around $24,000 for home improvements after paying off those debts. 

However, today I wanted to compare our options so I called my mortgage company (freedom mortgage) to see what they would offer for a HELOC, hoping for a lower interest rate. After a hard credit inquiry, the loan officer informed us that we don’t qualify for a HELOC due to credit score (I believe our average together was around 650) but could do a cash out refinance to consolidate debt and do home improvements.

Do I try and make payments earlier? Balance has already gone up around 10k after making monthly payments.

I make about 57K in the public sector and she makes about 70K in the private. I have just started to get into financing the last few days am just looking for some input on our financial outlook.

1. I plan on buying a new car once she has hers paid off. Looking at something around 30K and hoping to trade my car in for around 5K at the time. Looking at 2027 right now. 

2. We plan on trying to purchase a larger home in the coming years. Nothing immediate, just keeping our eyes on the market. We get priced out of most homes in our area. We bought our home at 140K and then completely remodeled it. Hoping to eventually sell for about 240K and use the roughly 90K we earn to put into a down payment for our new house. We are looking at something around 300K depending on what mortgage rates do the next few years. We also plan on saving more to add onto our downpayment.

3. We want to put our daughter through college. She is 3 and we currently have about 6K in a 529 for her. I put $130 every pay check into it.

4. Retirement. Being a public employee I have a pretty solid retirement from my employer. I also have a 403(B) currently open.  My wife has recently opened up a 401K at her work. I pay 150 into my 403(B) per week and my wife currently pays 87.46. We have been horrible about keeping track of both of our accounts. I know my wife should match whatever her employer will, but she is unsure what it is and is going to look into it.

  
Recently I opened up a fidelity account. I used some of the fidelity tools to try my best to create a balanced portfolio that is set up more in a growth direction. Here is the breakdown of my account. My goals in doing this are to help save to purchase the new car and house mentioned above, and then eventually leave money in the 500 for future investments.

I put in 3K to start and invested the following: 

a. Left 1500 in SPAXX Fidelity® Government Money Market Fund  
b. Put 1000 in FXAIX Fidelity 500 Index Fund

c. 150 in the FIVLX Fidelity International Value Fund

d. 250 in the FBGRX FIDELITY BLUE CHIP GROWTH

e. I have a 100 leftover that I wanted to try to use for some individual stocks and make some money on. I was planning on doing some more research into this. Right now the 100 is just sitting in my SPAXX so technically it's 1600.

  
We still have about 13K left in our savings and an additional 5.5K in our checkings. Being that I am new at this and the volatility of the current market I didn't want to put a ton of money in. I plan on taking future savings and investing it into our accounts once we build up our savings a little bit more. I know that we are under the 6 month emergency fund rule as well and am trying to get back up to that.

My wife also has about 40K in student loans but they are in limbo right now. She was in the public service loan forgiveness program but we really don't know what's happening. When we planned our new budget we budgeted to incorporate them into our monthly expenses.

Reddit,personalfinance,federal loan forgiveness,1mzr1t7,Home Sale / Purchase Advice (giving up low rate),"
Need some thoughts on a potential home sale/purchase next Spring, want to make sure my logic is sound here. 

We bought our first home in 2021 with a nice 2.87% interest rate. Thinking about selling to buy in a better location. Was originally hesitant to sell due to the rate difference, but after running some numbers it's starting to make sense. 

Bought the current house for ~$1M with 20% down, mortgage payment is $4.4k. I could sell for ~$1.2M and generate ~$400k net proceeds after commissions etc. 

New house would also be ~$1M with 20% down. Mortgage payment would go up to $6.1k, about $20k/year higher payment. 

BUT

1. I itemize deductions and would be able to deduct an extra $28k in mortgage interest, which would result in a $10k lower tax bill at the 35% federal rate. 

2. I would have $200k extra cash to invest (400 from sale - 200 down on new house). 5% net on that $200k would be another $10k/year.

$10k saved in taxes + $10k from investing the extra cash = $20k/year... the difference between my current and new mortgage payments. So essentially I'd be in the same annual cost position, just with more liquidity and less cash tied up in the house. 

The other big difference is that I'm currently paying ~$18k/year into principal and the new loan would likely be half that. So over 7 years (time horizon on new house) I will have paid ~$60k less into principal. There are also costs associated with moving, but not huge. And the new house would probably require some initial upgrades, but if we stay in the current house we'd do stuff here too so that's a wash. 

Seems crazy to give up a sub 3% rate for a new mortgage at 6.5%... let me know what I'm missing!

Reddit,personalfinance,federal loan forgiveness,1mz6cz3,Need Advice on Refinancing and Repairs with Navy Federal,"Hi everyone,

We recently tried to do a cash back refinance our house with Navy Federal. The process has been frustrating and drawn out. Every few weeks, they requested additional documents or information, testing and inspections, one at a time.  

The reason we wanted to refinance was to pay off some debt and make home upgrades, with the goal of putting the house on the market in a few years with a downpayment. It would lower our interest rate as well. 

We owe about 50k, home appraised at 230k, the refinance was for 120k. Our payment would be similar to what we are paying now. We'd be signing up for 30 years, but with the goal of selling I wasn't worried about it. 

After a couple of months of requesting various estimates for the work, we had our conditional approval removed. They now want us to make repairs before they'll approve the cash-back refinance. We had just finished the last thing they said they needed. It was all supposed to be over. Then they sent an email removing the conditional approval because of the AC.  

Originally, we were told they could do a holdback of the funds to cover repairs to the AC, but that no longer seems possible. The amount we wanted held back was around $12,000. There was some confusion over whether our house is a modular or a manufactured home, and for some reason, that became the reason they couldn’t do the cash-back refinance with a holdback.

They want us to repair the AC before approving the refinance. Ironically, one of the main reasons we wanted the refinance was to get the AC fixed. They even suggested taking out a loan to cover the AC repair, which feels a bit circular.

My husband has been experiencing cognitive decline, which has led to some financial mistakes. It’s not severe, and I’ve caught it early, but I don’t want to take on more debt if I don’t have to. We could pull from a 401K or take a bank loan if needed, but I’d rather avoid it.

My husband’s credit score and income is good according to them. 

I’m feeling a bit lost navigating this on my own. I could get the AC fixed, but there’s still a chance Navy Federal will find another reason not to approve the refinance. We could also try another lender, but I’m unsure if they’ll have the same requirements.

I would feel better about this if I felt Navy Federal was trustworthy, but this has been going on for a while now. 

Any advice welcomed. I'm exhausted. Thank you!

My income alone is not enough to cover all the bills every month, leaving us with a financial decision to make.

**Option 1** is draining our savings/emergency fee. It's not a lot, but we saved up a little bit of money to have something to fall back on. I haven't done the math yet, but I estimate that about 75% of our savings would be wiped out while she's out of work, and that it would likely take us about 2 years to recover it when she gets back to work and we have 2 incomes. My worry here is that our savings will be largely depleted and if anything comes up within the 2yrs it takes us to recover, we might be in trouble (but we might be able to use option 2 or 3 at that time).

**Option 2** is taking a loan from her 403(b). We would be taking about 50% of what's in the 403(b). We're not sure yet how long the term would be, 1-5 years. We were told that the current interest rate is 5.85%. I believe this might be the best option? Considering it leaves us our savings to fall back on in the future. Although repaying the loan would mean not being able to add as much to our savings/investments every month. My worry here is that if for any reason her job decides to let her go because of how long she'll be out of work, we could be on the hook for repaying the full value of the loan right away. Her job is only protected for so long. Her recovery time is suspected to be longer than the protection provided. 

**Option 3** is cashing out 50% of the 403(b) - which is what she's leaning towards. They would hold 20% for Federal taxes, plus hit us with a 10% penalty. There's also State taxes, right? We're in NY state. This option seems like it would be the worst of the 3 considering we're loosing a lot of money before we even get a dime, plus the possibility of future gains on that money we took. 

I could use some advice. When considering the options, it seems like option 2 would be the best, but then I start overthinking everything and don't know what to do.

Reddit,personalfinance,federal loan forgiveness,1mxl299,should i take out a personal loan to consolidate credit card debt?,"hey there! i’m in my early to mid twenties, a grad student who, despite a substantial fellowship, will be facing down the barrel of a lot of student loan (federal) debt come graduation.

a couple years back, i ended up houseless and had to go into a fair amount of credit card debt in order to keep myself employed and with a roof over my head (i was providing for 3 others at the time). since then i’ve struggled to get that debt under control. it’s just about $9,500 split across 3 cards. my APR for the cards are 27.99, 24.24, and 19.42.

through CreditKarma, i could likely get a personal loan from Avant to pay off this debt with an APR of 18.82, estimated monthly payment of $255 (currently, my combined monthly payments total out around $285).

would it be a smart move because the APR is substantially lower? the only other element that might factor in is that i have a car loan, $366 monthly payment and $5,255 left to pay

Reddit,personalfinance,federal loan forgiveness,1mwytcy,How would you manage this student loan debt? Refinancing?,"I graduated recently and landed a job a few months ago that pays $60k a year and $3300 monthly after taxes and contributions. I’m living at home and trying to make large payments on my student loan debt but would like to make plans move out and be in a stable place with my loans but am having a hard time knowing where to start or if what I’m doing is the right move.

The total minimum payments on my loans come up to a little less than $500 a month but I’ve been paying anywhere from $1000 to $2000 a month to try to pay them off quicker because my interest rates suck. I have around $30k in private loans through Sallie Mae as well as $26k in federal loans which are currently under an income based repayment plan. The federal loans have pretty low interest rates ranging from 2-4% but the Sallie Mae loans range from 9-12%. 

Would it be smart to refinance just the Sallie Mae loans and keep the federal loans? Is that even an option? My credit score is sitting at 790 according to Credit Karma so I’m wondering if I could get a better interest rate after consolidating. If I keep going at this rate, when would I be at a comfortable spot to be able to afford to move out? 

Rent for a 1b1b around me goes for $1700+ a month but I am considering a roommate which would bring it down to $1000-1500 depending on the area. I have enough for a first, last, and a security deposit sitting for when I do take the leap.

As for planning more long term, I am also investing into a Roth IRA and 401k but not any significant amounts compared to what I’m putting into my student loans. $200 a month towards the Roth and $250 ish towards the 401k.

I'm currently making close to 100k, and have been for 2 years. I can't afford to buy a house or even realistically rent on my own where I live ($2,000+/mo). I have 2 roommates currently. Due to my hobbies I need a garage, and I've already spent years living well below means to help my situation and simply don't have the apatite to do it any longer, so I've started doing some things for ""me"". 

Edit: a lot are saying I'm prioritizing or spending a lot on hobbies, so let me add that I've paid off $25k in private student loans, got out from under a $50k vehicle loan, and paid off another $30k in CC debt in the last 3 years. The current level of hobbie spending has been short and has a planned end date.

  
Debts: Just over $50k in student loans (federal, highest interest of \~5%), and a small motorcycle loan of $5k at \~7.3% (planning to pay off this year). I don't have credit card ""debt"" as I pay the full balance every month. 

Liquid Assets: \~$25k 401k (contributing 6% to get full company match at 3.5%), \~$5k non retirement accounts, \~$25k HYSA (emergency fund + ""checking""), \~$7k HSA 

Other Assets: \~$30-50k vehicles (a classic and a motorcycle, yes I daily them, working on a more modern replacement but will not finance). \~$10k in misc. stuff. The classic has sentimental value.

  
Currently and for the last 2 months I am spending all my spare money on some goals (a newer - 1993 - car to drive, and getting my pilots license - while I have roommates and still have spare cash, both will be paid for within a couple months then back to paying down debt/saving/investing or, if the roommate thing falls apart, it would all go to covering rent). Not having to make student loan payments has helped too, but now those are back to accruing interest so I will need to divert over $500/mo to that now too.

Reddit,personalfinance,loan forgiveness program,1mvk3xe,Tuition insurance worth it for my situation?,"Hi all,

I’m going back to school for a second masters degree this fall and saw that the school offers tuition insurance for ~$500 dollars per semester. My tuition per semester is about $12k that I am paying out of pocket ( no loans, etc).

Normally, I wouldn’t even consider something like this but I’m in an interesting situation. This is a part time program as I am a full time professional. My industry (biotech) is very volatile and there have been many layoffs lately, including where I work but thankfully I wasn’t impacted. 

Due to these external factors, I’m wondering if I should bite the bullet and insure my tuition in case more layoffs occur or I get another job that doesn’t give me the flexibility to attend school. I see a licensed therapist and if I were laid off could have her write a letter for stress/anxiety which seems to be a covered reason for withdrawal. 

I wouldn’t due this every semester of the three year program, but I’m thinking maybe the first two until I have a better idea of the industry (this administration has really changed things up with the FDA which has impacted my company).

Reddit,personalfinance,loan forgiveness program,1mv4s6d,can i afford to move out?,"hi, I’m a 25F currently living with my mom and twin brother in NY. right now, i have about $70k in savings that i use solely to repay student loans. by the time they are paid off, i will have about $33k left, at most.

i work an entry-level job, making ~$1600 each month. i get UI, as well as SNAP benefits, enough for one person with my dietary preferences. i do not own a car or have any children. i am pretty frugal, by choice and by circumstance..

Reddit,personalfinance,loan forgiveness program,1mutdbs,"Inheriting 2 Homes w/ Back Taxes, What Should I Do First?","A little bit of backstory. I've recently been asked by my family to take ownership of 2 family houses that we have been having trouble maintaining as a family. These two homes have been in our family for generations, and for a while one person was maintaining them, but as of late the financial burden of maintaining these homes has become too great for that family member, and they have asked me to take on the responsibility of maintaining the homes.

While this is all very exciting there's a list of issues that need to be addressed in order move forward:

1. Each home is behind on back taxes. The total burden is a little over $10K, which doesn't appear to be extreme, but I am not financially capable of paying all it off in a reasonable amount of time.
2. Each home is in disrepair and will need to be renovated before they can be used.

The great news is that each home is fully paid off. I'm here to ask for advice on the best moves to make where I won't be immediately financially crippled by putting the homes in my name, and to see what I should do first to get each home back on track. Ideally we want to continue to own both homes because everyone keeps saying that property ownership is always best. So here are my questions:

What's the best way to transfer the homes in my name? I've heard of starting an LLC, I've heard of not transferring deeds, but being added to the deed, etc.

Are there any programs or solutions to assist with the tax burden? Also, would I be fully responsible for the taxes?

I assume that taking a loan out on one of the homes in order to repair the damages and pay the taxes would be an end goal, but what type of lean should I go for, how would I request such a loan, and would I be considered ""well qualified"" for said loan?

All advice is greatly appreciated!

Reddit,personalfinance,loan forgiveness program,1murtso,Help Deciding 401K loan vs No Interest Program with a catch,"Hey everyone, so I'm in a spot were I have to replace two HVAC systems in full. I'm not sitting on that kind of cash right now, and have two choices the way I see it. I can go through an approved contractor with my electric company and they offer a no interest program for 84 months. My other option is to take out a 401K loan and pay that back instead.

Here's the catch. Going through the program all of my estimates are maxing out the program. Basically you get up to $25K interest free and quotes are running $25-$28K. Through a friend that just had her system done, she was connected to a bunch of Union guys that do HVAC on the side. From initial talks he is saying he could likely get both systems done for $20K. 

So the question is, do I pay more and leave the 401K alone, or save $5-8K on the systems knowing that I'm paying myself back with interest but also know that $20K is out of the market where my YTD return in 2025 has been roughly 14%.

Reddit,medicine,student loan forgiveness,1ihmbm0,If it gets much worse... what do we do? US healthcare workers.,"I am mortified in new ways every day of the direction of things. I am losing hope faster than I realized I ever could. Im in my first year of med school thus already saddled with debt. I am worried I'll have to take out private loans in the future and be screwed the rest of my life, Im worried debt repayment programs for phsyicans will become a thing of the past.

As a healthcare worker/student Im mortified what this will mean for those I care about, for the patients I have seen when I worked at the hospital as a CNA. I am scared for those I know who directly are affected already in major ways. Im scared once I become a doctor to have to comply with awful legislation and that people will die because I legally cannot act. Yes it's years in the future, a lot could happen in 4 years, but I have seen nothing but doom and very little actual hope. It feels almost engineered.

As a patient/human/queer woman I am worried for myself, if I will be able to continue the meds I am on that have been life changing for the better. I am worried for my health and what will happen to me and others in worse positions than me. I am fearful for it all.

I feel the only way I can actively AND effectively oppose is to give up on my dreams of becoming a doctor to take up the good fight because Im already worn thin by my duties within med school that I cannot do more than complain online or have discussions with people irl to continue to push for change/make calls that feel as if they fall on deaf ears.

Im worried if It gets worse, what the hell do we do? Could I even move while saddled with the incredible debt I will have/already have accumulated due to medical school? Would I be extradited if I refused to pay? Would I still have to give up my dream of becoming a doctor if I moved? It's all so uncertain and it greatly upsets me. I try to hold onto what hope I can, hope that in 4 years I will become a doctor, that in 4 years things will start to change for good and that we all wake up and do things to push for that.

So I ask the adult adults here, what the hell do we do? It feels like calling isn't enough, mailing isn't enough hell talking isn't enough.

Edit: to also add, I acknowledge one can't ""just up and leave."" I know its a lengthy process but it almost feels like a safer decision than staying here. I just worry about my future/career on top of my safety in all of this.

I am worried I'll have to take out private loans in the future and be screwed the rest of my life, Im worried debt repayment programs for phsyicans will become a thing of the past.

As a healthcare worker/student Im mortified what this will mean for those I care about, for the patients I have seen when I worked at the hospital as a CNA. I am scared for those I know who directly are affected already in major ways. Im scared once I become a doctor to have to comply with awful legislation and that people will die because I legally cannot act. Yes it's years in the future, a lot could happen in 4 years, but I have seen nothing but doom and very little actual hope. It feels almost engineered.

As a patient/human/queer woman I am worried for myself, if I will be able to continue the meds I am on that have been life changing for the better. I am worried for my health and what will happen to me and others in worse positions than me. I am fearful for it all.

I feel the only way I can actively AND effectively oppose is to give up on my dreams of becoming a doctor to take up the good fight because Im already worn thin by my duties within med school that I cannot do more than complain online or have discussions with people irl to continue to push for change/make calls that feel as if they fall on deaf ears.

Im worried if It gets worse, what the hell do we do? Could I even move while saddled with the incredible debt I will have/already have accumulated due to medical school? Would I be extradited if I refused to pay? Would I still have to give up my dream of becoming a doctor if I moved? It's all so uncertain and it greatly upsets me. I try to hold onto what hope I can, hope that in 4 years I will become a doctor, that in 4 years things will start to change for good and that we all wake up and do things to push for that.

So I ask the adult adults here, what the hell do we do? It feels like calling isn't enough, mailing isn't enough hell talking isn't enough.

Edit: to also add, I acknowledge one can't ""just up and leave."" I know its a lengthy process but it almost feels like a safer decision than staying here. I just worry about my future/career on top of my safety in all of this.

Edit 2: I appreciate all the feedback and comments, Im gonna block socials for awhile bc I think focusing completely on school/my own sanity will help me stay level headed despite the shit, Ill still see the news without socials but this helps me avoid the algorithm which def keeps me trapped in this doom spiral",,,,

Reddit,medicine,student loan forgiveness,198ifag,The Hypocritical Oath: How healthcare stopped taking care of itself and why the answer is to leave,"Healthcare is broken.   

Over the past few years moral injury has become the preferred word in replacement of burn out. There’s a recognition that the fault isn’t on the individual to do better, but that people are not able to work within their values and provide the care they know to be ethical. The answer for this dissonance for many is to take on the massive task of systems change.   

Unfortunately, I believe the only answer is to leave. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

\---**The Blind Leading the Blind---**

I suffered with depression throughout my teens and 20s and it’s only recently that I’ve seen a pathway out.  

There were weeks where I wouldn’t leave my house and managing life depended on periodic bursts of energy that made up for my inability to show up day to day. The learned habit of cramming for exams became a way of living. It helped me to be productive enough, and through the eyes of many I was an overachiever. I was president of my professional fraternity, vice president of the multicultural student association in nursing school, a resident advisor, dual major, and completed a Doctor of Nursing Practice while serving as the president of my graduate schools organization.   

I learned how to play the game well enough to have the privilege of suffering in silence. Not much changed when I entered professional life.   
I was drawn to mental health because I understood what many of my future patients experience.  
There’s a quote I love from an author Frank Warren who says:  

“it’s the children the world almost breaks who grow up to save it.”   

This quote has always stuck with me because I know this to be true of many healers. 

Unfortunately the consequence of almost being broken means you’re drawn to repair others wounds while you’re working on repairing your own.  

I fundamentally believe that healing people heal people, but the traditional healthcare system is both the best and the worse place for people like me to land. 

  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

  
\---**Do as I say, not as I do---**

During covid there was a period where my mental health took a turn for the worse and while I continued to work, the truth is I was a hypocrite.    

I had 10 hour days seeing patients back to back for 15-20 minutes at a time who shared their first person narratives of the worst of the human experience. As a psychiatric nurse practitioner, my job was straight forward. Change their meds or start new ones, give words of encouragement, tell them about healthy habits, remind them about the promises of mindfulness and exercise and send them off with fingers crossed that things would improve knowing full well that it wasn’t their brain chemistry that was a problem.   

The problem was the social and economic issues that created the conditions for their trauma to exist in the first place.   

Deep down I knew I wasn’t helping but I needed to keep a job. How else was I going to get by? I ended those days avoiding the gym, too tired to cook, too lazy to meditate, too annoyed to read and learn, too frustrated with myself to take my own advice.   

I’m reminded of the cardiologist who is overweight and refuses to exercise but prescribes this treatment plan to their patients. I’m reminded of the therapist who treats trauma but refuses to turn behind them and look at their own shadows. I’m reminded of the administrator who read Brene Brown and started to tout the benefits of radical vulnerability but refused to let anyone ever see them crack.   

Healthcare is full of hypocrites and it isn’t any of their faults, because in reality they’re all products of the biggest hypocrite of them all.

  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**---The first principle of medical ethics: Do no harm.---**  

Professional caregivers are overworked and under resourced, but many are stuck because medical education comes with significant costs - the burden of repaying student loans.  

Too many are attached to a ball and chain with the hope and a dream that in 10 years of dedicated service they can finally breathe. So they continue to push through long hours, emotionally taxing work where they know they’re only offering bandaids while grappling with the perpetual fear of making critical errors.   

While entrusted with preserving health for the masses, they become victims of its erosion.  

The first law in medical ethics is to do no harm, yet with great irony, in its current form, healthcare stands as a paradox – a realm designed to heal that instead harms its own.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
\---**Coming to light**\---  

I experienced a cognitive dissonance from treating symptoms and not the root while selling fantasies of a psychotropic answer when the problem was a crisis of disconnection - it led to an obsession with systems change.   

As a mental health worker I fell in love with the potential for psychedelics to return healing to a bio-psycho-spiritual way of relating with ourselves and others. I felt a personal duty to educate therapists, prescribers and administrators naive to psychedelic medicine out of hope that if enough people saw their potential they could join a local movement to help change the system.  

I thought that if psychedelic therapy could become accessible in traditional community mental health, patients would have a doorway for their exit. I hoped that it could allow them to realize they didn’t need us to save them - only they could save themselves.   

I dreamed that it would allow them to move on because I knew that community mental health wasn’t a place of healing. It was a system of harm reduction that exists because our broken society needs a safety net for those most impacted.   
It was quite telling that my hope for them was that they could find their way out. It took me too long to realize that I needed to find my own way out, too.   

Healthcare is a multi-trillion dollar industry driven by people that care about the bottom line.   
It’s a business.   

It is not run primarily by clinicians but by people who have to prioritize financial metrics over compassion. It’s a one that will replace you in a heart beat by a bright eyed new grad whose yet to understand the nature of the beast, excited for their opportunity to make real change only to realize they are a small cog in a very large machine - and best of all, one guided by the invisible hand of a pharmaceutical industry that generates over $500 Billion in revenue a year.   

This is the system you think can change?   

I had a good friend who once said happiness is a product of living in alignment with your values. Humans are indeed morally idealistic creatures who judge themselves, whether they know it or not, by their alignment with their deeply held principles.  

The business of healthcare is not aligned with my values and my guess is they aren’t aligned with yours either.   

I knew while I was in it, I could keep working to sooth my cognitive dissonance. I could focus on changing my piece of the system, but the reality is that I wasn’t doing it for the system, I was doing it for myself. I noticed all around me that the only people who could create a lifelong career in traditional healthcare had one of two choices: build their defenses and become jaded or let it eat you alive.   

Eventually, I knew the only answer wasn’t to try and change the system, it was to leave. It’s why I entered the psychedelic field - to find a balance that was missing in traditional healthcare.

  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

  
\---**Be the systems change you want to see in the world---**  

I’m no longer a believer in systems change.   
The larger the system the more static and any progress would inevitably be swallowed by the incentives of the whole. There are amazing people who dedicate their lives to systemic transformation. The worlds needs these people. It needs them as much as it needs people to wake up from their disassociation and start to carve a new path for themselves rooted in their values.   

While not the best anology, this dynamic makes me think of the Death Star.   

For those who have never seen Star Wars, the Death Star is a planet destroying weapon operated by robots and people just doing their jobs. I imagine that many of the humans in this weapon are good people just trying to make a living, sold on a mission that they’re work is necessary. I jokingly think that when these people wake up to their reality, they might start to experience moral injury. Perhaps they create a working group to unravel this system and the administrators cave by hiring a Chief Wellness Officer and a Director of Social Impact.   

At the end of the day, they’re still working in the Death Star.  

The system will exist without you. The gears will always be replaced. If your values are rubbing up against those within the conditions of your work, it’s time to stop making excuses. The world is better off with you adding value to the world where you don’t have to compromise on your values.

Reddit,medicine,student loan forgiveness,18lven9,Once upon a time...,"There was a doctor who had been selected by all the doctors to meet with The Great Healthcare Council to decide how doctors should be paid.  Goats and chickens were no longer legal tender, so this doctor was selected as the bravest and brightest to negotiate in these dire times.

Upon arriving at the large ivory tower where the GHC resided, the doctor entered the massive chamber and found a politician, an insurance company executive, a pharmaceutical representative, and a hospital administrator.  

As the doctor walked in to the chamber, the GHC scowled.  ""Why are *you* here?"" they hissed.

The doctor replied, ""The goats and chickens are no longer allowed to pay for the services we provide.  I have come to negotiate fair pay.""

The GHC stared coldly.  ""Come in.  Close the door.""

The doctor closed the giant oak door, sauntered to a large table in the far side of the room, sat down on a cold, padded stool with wheels, and looked up at the Council.  

The GHC nodded, and the doctor began his case.

""I have trained for nearly a decade to learn, diagnose, and treat complex medical conditions.  I can perform procedures few others can do.  This requires a significant skillset.  It is through this medical decision making and procedures that the GHC is able to care for the sick, prevent disease, and generate the revenue needed to keep everything running.  I am here to simply ask that we be paid fairly for our services.""

The GHC peered down at the doctor and whispered, ""You want *fair pay*?""

The doctor nodded sheepishly.

""We cannot pay you a salary.  Your hours are too variable.""

The doctor nodded sheepishly.

""We cannot pay you hourly.  You will become lazy and stop seeing patients.""

The doctor nodded sheepishly.

""If we are not getting paid, then why should you get paid?  That only seems *fair*, right?""

The doctor nodded sheepishly.

The GHC huddled together.  There was frantic discussion.  The doctor sat and waited on his stool.

At long last, the GHC confidently took their position and in unison explained the new plan.  ""You will be paid by something called an RVU.  We definitely did *not* just make these numbers up.  The more RVUs you generate, the better.  Do more procedures?  Make more money.  See more patients?  Make more money.  Do not waste time in primary care.  Send them on to someone who can make real money for us.  Quality is not the issue here.  Quantity is how you line your pockets.  If you cannot keep up, then you are worthless.  If we make money, then you make money.""

The doctor nodded sheepishly, but at this raised his hand.

Annoyed, the GHC acknowledged the doctor.

""So I will be paid for the work that I do?""

The GHC grinned.  ""Well, no.  You will be paid for the work you document and *code* for.""

""So I will not be paid directly for my expertise?  I will be paid based on how well I can write a note and apply codes to that note?  Will I receive training in this?""

""Almost none.""

""Will someone with expertise review these notes and apply the appropriate codes for me so that I can at least maximize the amount I am paid?""

The GHC shrugged.  It appears as if they had stopped listening halfway through his last question.

Perplexed, the doctor continued. ""But I will be paid to review labs, refill medications, call patients, and answer patient questions?  And if I have to do notes after hours or on my days off?""

The GHC stared blankly at the doctor.  ""Why should we pay you for *that*?""

The doctor thought for a moment.  He knew he should say something, but didn't know what to say.  Instead, he sat quietly on his stool and slowly spun in a circle, pressed the lever on the side, and lowered himself down.  At this moment he remembered his badge was on a retractable string.  He extended his badge and let go.  The badge reeled back up and made an audible ""zip"" noise as it retracted back to its resting position.  At this, the doctor repositioned himself on the stool and carried on.

""So I get paid based on my notes and my coding.  Ok.  So I will at least have someone to write my notes then, right?""

The GHC squinted their eyes and scrunched their eyebrows.  After a moment of contemplation, the GHC responded, ""If you make enough money, then yes.  If you choose to spend most of your time in clinic, then no.  You have not done enough to earn the help.""

Remembering that advocating for his well-being would require he speak up, the doctor decided to move on.  At this point, the doctor had an idea. ""What if we were paid based on how well we take care of patients?""

After a moment of silence, the GHC agreed.  But it would only be a small part of the wage, and they would get to set the terms of what that meant.

The doctor smiled.  He saw no way that this could be used against him.

Impatiently, the GHC inquired, ""Any other requests?""

""Regular wage increases to keep up with inflation will be part of this too, right?""

The GHC nodded their heads, fingers crossed behind their backs.

The doctor, a bit skeptical, knew his time was running short.  ""So let me get this straight.  After 7+ years of training and six figures of student loans, you will be paying me based on randomly assigned numbers for how I code notes that I write myself, you will set patient quality metrics for me that most likely will be based on how a human I have no control over behaves, and I won't be paid for answering emails, messages, answering labs, calling patients, or other extra duties?  All the while you will collect on those patient visits and invest those dollars into profits, denying patient healthcare, and hiring even more administrators to oversee the work that I am doing?""

""Correct.""  The GHC slid a contract across the table to doctor.

The doctor took a long look at the contract, sighed, and responded, ""Can I at least use some of my CME money to attend my specialty conference at Disney Land?""

The GHC replied, ""Yes.  But we need receipts.  And you have to pay for your own booze.""

The doctor, excitedly pulled a pen he stole from the hospital out of his shirt pocket, clicked once, and eagerly signed the paper.  He shook hands with each member of the GHC and strutted out the door, eager to tell the other doctors about the good news.

""What a great deal,"" he proclaimed. ""I love Mickey Mouse.""

There was a doctor who had been selected by all the doctors to meet with The Great Healthcare Council to decide how doctors should be paid.  Goats and chickens were no longer legal tender, so this doctor was selected as the bravest and brightest to negotiate in these dire times.

Upon arriving at the large ivory tower where the GHC resided, the doctor entered the massive chamber and found a politician, an insurance company executive, a pharmaceutical representative, and a hospital administrator.  

As the doctor walked in to the chamber, the GHC scowled.  ""Why are *you* here?"" they hissed.

The doctor replied, ""The goats and chickens are no longer allowed to pay for the services we provide.  I have come to negotiate fair pay.""

The GHC stared coldly.  ""Come in.  Close the door.""

The doctor closed the giant oak door, sauntered to a large table in the far side of the room, sat down on a cold, padded stool with wheels, and looked up at the Council.  

The GHC nodded, and the doctor began his case.

""I have trained for nearly a decade to learn, diagnose, and treat complex medical conditions.  I can perform procedures few others can do.  This requires a significant skillset.  It is through this medical decision making and procedures that the GHC is able to care for the sick, prevent disease, and generate the revenue needed to keep everything running.  I am here to simply ask that we be paid fairly for our services.""

The GHC peered down at the doctor and whispered, ""You want *fair pay*?""

The doctor nodded sheepishly.

""We cannot pay you a salary.  Your hours are too variable.""

Reddit,medicine,student loan forgiveness,172b4ey,Anyone else getting screwed over with the SAVE student loan plan?,"So my wife and I make about 500k combined. We were on the REPAYE plan paying about 2k/mo each since before the pandemic. 

Life was good, REPAYE calculated our payment at 10% of AGI and split that payment between the two of us, essentially making it so we paid 5% each of our combined AGI.

Pandemic happened, 2+ years of loan pause, and now we have the SAVE plan which is supposed to be better than REPAYE, but of course isnt. 

I checked with our servicer first week of September and everything looked good. Payments stayed the same, our plan was automatically moved to SAVE plan and had reflected that on the website next to our payment amount. 

Of course our servicer didn’t have their shit together and had updated the payment to now be $3200 and $3500, close to $7000 combined. Not sure how they arrived at that number since our income has never gone above $600k and much less for AGI.

Compared to REPAYE, SAVE plan changes the payment calculation to 10% combined AGI split between the two partners only if married filing separately. It used to be married filing jointly would qualify for this benefit. Because of this small change, my wife and I each have to pay 10% of our combined income. We are essentially being penalized for being married.

A quick search through the student loan forums shows we are not alone, and some servicer errors include calculating family size incorrectly. Income calculation should be at 2019 levels until 2024. It would require time on the phone in an attempt to correct it but I fear as always that we are being screwed.

Reddit,medicine,PSLF,158gb5m,Personal Finance for New July Trainees and Attendings? (Come bring your wisdom and questions),"This week many of our new colleagues will be receiving their very first paycheck as residents or attendings. Just wanted to share a couple of general thoughts – things that I wish I knew about personal finance and learned on the way. 

Hoping to start a discussion and have us crowd source some tips, or ask financial related questions in a safe and supportive community! 

Please note this is not individual investing advice! I’m just an academic faculty who is hugely passionate about personal finance and wellness for physicians.

**Things I wish I knew as a new resident**

-	A common rule of thumb for starting out budgeting is to use the 50-30-20 rule. From your take home (after taxes) pay each month, 50% goes to necessities such as rent, mortgage, bills, 30% goes to discretionary or fun spending (out with friends, gadgets, etc), and 20% goes to savings (such as emergency fund, then retirement accounts). Of course this varies based on your personal situation – if you have extensive financial obligations with a large family, or significant student debt, you may need to adjust the numbers. 

-	Compound interest is really powerful! And it is never too early to start saving for retirement. A 25 year old who invests $500 each month into broad index funds (we’ll talk about this later) will likely become a millionaire by age 65 (assuming ~7% annual growth per historical measures). Of course $500 is a lot of money for trainees, but any amount you put into investments counts in the long run.

-	Don’t be afraid of investing, especially in retirement accounts. Finance and investing can seem very daunting. However know that you do not need to know market trends or pick the hottest stocks. Almost all of your academic institutions will have retirement programs set up with large credible financial institutions such as vangard, fidelity, schwab, etc. By default a lot of employees are automatically enrolled (or at least encouraged to put in a small %) in target date funds. The benefit is that they are well-diversified (meaning you will own a huge portfolio of different stocks and bonds), and generally perform well on a long-term basis following the trends of the overall US market. 

-	What’s the difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional 401k? The biggest is WHEN you are taxed. Roth is basically contributions made AFTER taxes, and when you take the money out later it is tax free* (assuming you are 59.5 years old and had the account for at least 5 years). Traditional 401k contributions are BEFORE taxes, where it is taken out of your earnings and you can reduce your taxes for that year, but will have to pay later in life when you withdraw. 403(b)s are just the tax-exempt organisations such as academic institutions, hospitals, etc. In general it may be better for trainees to go with the Roth as your taxes now are going to be much lower than your attending or retirement years.

-	Always take the match if offered by your institution – as it is free money! For instance if your hospital offers a 5% match, you should at least contribute 5% from your paycheck into retirement, as they will match an additional 5%.

-	Check to make sure your retirement accounts are NOT sitting in money market funds! An overly simplified explanation is that it’s a pool of money that sloshes around in your institutional account PRIOR to being invested. It generally gets very tiny gains in interest (&lt;1-3%) and you may have to manually select to invest that money into broad index funds or target date funds. As I mentioned before many institutions default employees into index funds or target date funds, but you want to check and make sure that it is not sitting and missing out on years of growth. 

**Things I wish I knew as a new attending**

-	Get an own-occupation disability + term-life insurance plan ASAP. Ideally the sooner you do this coming out of training (or even while still a resident!) the cheaper the rates are. Its always good to have insurance in case something catastrophic happens. 

-	Make sure your beneficiaries are up to date on all your accounts

-	Should I pay off student debt or invest? I think psychologically it always feels good to pay off your debts and get the sense of freedom. However mathematically the answer depends on interest rates. If your student debt is at 0% interest, then you should pay minimum and put every penny you have into investments. If your debt is at a massive interest of 8-10%, then you should proritise it as that can snowball on you. Anything else in the middle is based on personal preference, see if you can park your money elsewhere for a higher rate (ex: HYSA in banks getting 4%, or investments averaging 7%)

-	(I don’t talk about PSLF here as I am not that knowledgeable – in general I’ve heard it’s a great program if you can qualify)


-	After you max out your annual retirement contribution limits ($22,500 in 2023 or 30,000 for aged 50+), the next place you can go to is a taxable brokerage account. Stick with your large institution (vanguard, fidelity, etc) and consider broad index funds

-	By this time you may be thinking of buying a home. I don’t have a crystal ball and the housing market trends are too complex for this discussion, but in general your mortgage rate is reflective of the central bank interest rate. (Ex: a $500k house at 30 years would be $1686 monthly at 3%, and $2398 at 6%) A home that may be more affordable at lower rates may not be when rates are higher. 

If you’ve gotten to here so far – thanks for reading! And congrats on your first paycheck.

-	What’s the difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional 401k? The biggest is WHEN you are taxed. Roth is basically contributions made AFTER taxes, and when you take the money out later it is tax free* (assuming you are 59.5 years old and had the account for at least 5 years). Traditional 401k contributions are BEFORE taxes, where it is taken out of your earnings and you can reduce your taxes for that year, but will have to pay later in life when you withdraw. 403(b)s are just the tax-exempt organisations such as academic institutions, hospitals, etc. In general it may be better for trainees to go with the Roth as your taxes now are going to be much lower than your attending or retirement years.

-	Always take the match if offered by your institution – as it is free money! For instance if your hospital offers a 5% match, you should at least contribute 5% from your paycheck into retirement, as they will match an additional 5%.

-	Check to make sure your retirement accounts are NOT sitting in money market funds! An overly simplified explanation is that it’s a pool of money that sloshes around in your institutional account PRIOR to being invested. It generally gets very tiny gains in interest (&lt;1-3%) and you may have to manually select to invest that money into broad index funds or target date funds. As I mentioned before many institutions default employees into index funds or target date funds, but you want to check and make sure that it is not sitting and missing out on years of growth. 

**Things I wish I knew as a new attending**

-	Get an own-occupation disability + term-life insurance plan ASAP. Ideally the sooner you do this coming out of training (or even while still a resident!) the cheaper the rates are. Its always good to have insurance in case something catastrophic happens. 

-	Make sure your beneficiaries are up to date on all your accounts

-	Should I pay off student debt or invest? I think psychologically it always feels good to pay off your debts and get the sense of freedom. However mathematically the answer depends on interest rates. If your student debt is at 0% interest, then you should pay minimum and put every penny you have into investments. If your debt is at a massive interest of 8-10%, then you should proritise it as that can snowball on you. Anything else in the middle is based on personal preference, see if you can park your money elsewhere for a higher rate (ex: HYSA in banks getting 4%, or investments averaging 7%)

-	(I don’t talk about PSLF here as I am not that knowledgeable – in general I’ve heard it’s a great program if you can qualify)


-	After you max out your annual retirement contribution limits ($22,500 in 2023 or 30,000 for aged 50+), the next place you can go to is a taxable brokerage account. Stick with your large institution (vanguard, fidelity, etc) and consider broad index funds

-	By this time you may be thinking of buying a home. I don’t have a crystal ball and the housing market trends are too complex for this discussion, but in general your mortgage rate is reflective of the central bank interest rate. (Ex: a $500k house at 30 years would be $1686 monthly at 3%, and $2398 at 6%) A home that may be more affordable at lower rates may not be when rates are higher. 

If you’ve gotten to here so far – thanks for reading! And congrats on your first paycheck. Cheers.",,,,

U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

# Ranking Member Sanders Asks Health Care Providers for Information on Republicans’ Budget Bill

WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), requested information from health care providers across the country on the impact of Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill.

This bill will slash federal health care programs by over $1 trillion and throw 16 million people off their health insurance. Congress has a solemn responsibility to the American people to gather input on the impact of these policies before the bill is considered on the Senate floor. But Republicans are rushing this bill forward without holding a single committee hearing or markup. Ranking Member Sanders welcomes information from all health care providers, including community health centers, hospitals, rural health clinics, individual clinicians and provider groups.

Responses may be submitted to [*providerinput@help.senate.gov*](mailto:providerinput@help.senate.gov) by **June 20, 2025.** Read the full request letter [here](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/6.12.25-Letter-to-Providers-Final.pdf) or below.

To: All Interested Health Care Providers

The Senate is currently considering the largest cuts to federal health care programs in the history of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These cuts—outlined in the budget reconciliation bill that just passed the House—will slash federal health care programs by over $1 trillion[\[1\]](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61461) and eliminate enhanced premium tax credits, causing 16 million people to lose their health insurance.[\[2\]](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf)

The bill could turn the crisis in American health care into a national emergency. Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania estimate that, as a result of these cuts and other provisions in the bill, over 51,000 people will die unnecessarily every year.[\[3\]](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/LDI-Yale-Letter-Final-1.pdf) Seniors will see their premiums go up,[\[4\]](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/Wyden-Pallone_Letter.pdf) children and people with disabilities will lose their health insurance,[\[5\]](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/05/06/rescinding-the-eligibility-and-enrollment-rule-would-thwart-efforts-to-improve-efficiency-in-medicaid-and-efforts-to-reduce-improper-payments/) and working families who are struggling to get by will have to pay a $35 “sick tax” when they need to go to the doctor or the hospital.[\[6\]](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)

Remarkably, despite the major changes contemplated, the Senate is poised to pass the reconciliation bill without the benefit of a single committee hearing or markup. No doctor, nurse, hospital, community health center, or nursing home has been formally consulted to help explain to the American people what these proposed changes would actually mean. In contrast, when Congress enacted the ACA, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP Committee) held the longest markup in its history, considering hundreds of amendments from members of both parties and soliciting feedback from hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes.

For this reason, I am seeking input from health care providers across the country. The HELP Committee needs to hear from the nation’s providers about what this means for organizations and their patients. I ask that you submit answers to the following questions to [providerinput@help.senate.gov](mailto:providerinput@help.senate.gov) by June 20, 2025:

1. How would the health care provisions in the House reconciliation bill impact your ability to care for patients?
2. Would the proposed cuts to Medicaid and the ACA require you to cut back on clinical staff, services, or care delivery? Please explain if possible.
3. What do you think will be the overall effect of the health care provisions in the House reconciliation bill on the American people?

The House reconciliation bill also contains a series of technical provisions that will seriously impact patient care. If appropriate, I ask that you also answer the following specific questions:

1. Would Medicaid work requirements, more frequent Medicaid eligibility reviews, and more burdensome documentation requirements associated with enrollment in ACA coverage require you to hire specialized administrative staff? If so, how many staff members do you anticipate hiring?
2. How many additional hours of paperwork do you anticipate having to complete on behalf of patients to help them keep their insurance coverage?
3. How do you anticipate the moratorium on Medicaid provider taxes will affect access to care and payment rates for struggling providers in your state?
4. What will be the impact of changing the financing of the ACA’s cost-sharing reductions from “silver loading” to direct payment? Will it result in more uninsured residents or more bad debt for providers?
5. How will rescinding the eligibility and enrollment regulations impact seniors, people with disabilities, and children? Will it result in higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, and higher uninsured rates for these populations?

Thank you in advance for your thoughtful responses to these questions.

Sincerely,

Bernard Sanders

Reddit,medicine,public service forgiveness,1l9vvnt,Physician trust in the June Quinnipiac Poll,"I mean this as a musing I guess, but this month's Quinnipiac Poll was recently released, and there was a [question on vaccine beliefs](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3924#question-33). ""In thinking about how you decide whether or not to get vaccines for yourself or other family members, who would you say you trust the most for guidance; your doctor, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the CDC, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or yourself?"" (recreated the table here for reference, sample size is 1000+ random adults according to their methodology)

Unfortunately they don't have any trend information on the question in their [trends document](https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us06112025_trends_usfa29.pdf).

# CDC Update: What Happened?

In a move that has stunned much of the medical community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in healthy children and pregnant women. The announcement, made via a social media video by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., did not follow the usual protocols for public health policy development. There was no convening of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), no new large-scale study, no meeting minutes—just a camera, a platform, and a gut feeling.

Secretary Kennedy claimed the removal was due to a lack of evidence supporting boosters in these populations and framed it as a return to ""individualized care."" However, critics were quick to point out that removing a universal recommendation, especially without supporting evidence or expert review, has serious implications: for insurance coverage, vaccine access, and public trust.

Pregnant women, once considered a high-risk group for COVID complications, are now left without national guidance on a vaccine that once dramatically reduced poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Children, while at lower personal risk, also play a role in community transmission—another fact seemingly ignored in the abrupt reversal.

# The Noble Nocturnist’s Reaction: More Than a Gut Feeling

I’ll be blunt: this move by the CDC, spearheaded by RFK Jr., doesn’t feel like public health policy—it feels like performance art. The kind you do when you want applause from a crowd, not better outcomes for patients. There was no ACIP review. No FDA signal. No new peer-reviewed trial. Just… vibes.

It’s hard to reconcile this with how vaccine policy has traditionally been formed—slow, data-driven, consensus-based, often to a fault. The whole process used to involve rigorous vetting through layers of expert committees. Now it’s one guy with a social media account and a microphone saying, “Nah, we’re good.” Imagine replacing decades of epidemiology, maternal-fetal medicine, and immunology with “my uncle said so at dinner.” That’s where we are.

There’s a dark irony in watching someone who once told the world not to trust him for medical advice suddenly become the national voice of vaccine guidance. He doesn’t just disregard expert panels—he leapfrogs them entirely. It’s “policy by podcast guest,” not policy by evidence.

And let’s be real—when ideology leads policy, patients pay. In their wallets. With their health. And sometimes, with their lives. I was a hospitalist during the darkest days of the pandemic. I’ve watched young pregnant women—just a short time from their due date—crash and burn from COVID. High flow, Bi-PAP, Intubated. And that was after we had some of the tools to prevent it.

| Hospitalization              | 3.0–5.0                                       | [1–3]              |

| ICU admission                | 1.5–3.0                                       | [5][6][3–4]        |
| Mechanical ventilation       | 1.7–2.9                                       | [5][3–4]           |

The outcomes data on COVID in pregnancy isn’t ambiguous. Pregnant people are at significantly higher risk for ICU admission, intubation, and death.These findings are supported by large cohort studies and meta-analyses, and are consistent with the previous consensus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and major obstetric societies, which recommend COVID-19 vaccination for all pregnant individuals to reduce the risk of severe maternal and perinatal complications.\\\[7\\\]\\\[9-10\\\]  The vaccine offers real protection, and pulling back recommendations without a robust evidentiary basis endangers that progress. But hey, maybe all the evidence “felt sus” and just “didn’t hit right” with the current administration’s rhetoric.

Sure, I’ll acknowledge the ACIP didn’t originally recommend boosters for all healthy individuals either. And yes, the CDC overrode them back then—also controversial, although arguably retrospectively the data shows they made the right choice in the table below.  So political influence on public health isn’t new. But that precedent doesn’t justify doubling down. It highlights the exact danger of removing data and transparency from the equation.

If you're wondering why this decision happened without process, well… welcome to Trump’s America, where the governing philosophy seems to be “do it loud, do it fast, and if it owns the libs, even better.” And why would you need evidence when millions of people will celebrate it just for the spectacle?

I’m not the only one feeling this. Behind closed doors, in break rooms and group chats, doctors are seething. This isn't just about guidelines—it’s about being gaslit after years of trauma. I hope every policymaker who backed this gets the healthcare system they voted for. But they won’t. They’ll get concierge care, fly out of state, and leave the rest behind.

For the rest of us? We’ll keep treating the fallout. As usual.

# Global Context: Through the Looking Glass

Globally, the rest of the medical world is still living in a reality where infectious disease follows immunology and public health decisions come with citations. The World Health Organization continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women and other at-risk groups based on—brace yourself—actual outcomes data. But here in the U.S., our national policy now apparently runs on gut feelings, campaign slogans, and whatever RFK Jr. hallucinated into a microphone that morning.

This isn’t just an American quirk anymore. It’s a full-blown, exportable model of anti-intellectual governance: let’s politicize science, undermine public health institutions, and then act surprised when nobody trusts doctors, vaccines, or public policy. If the CDC can’t be counted on to follow its own advisory committee, why should your patients believe anything else they say? Today it’s COVID boosters for pregnant women—tomorrow it’s what, skipping tetanus shots because animal bites are “natural”?

We're creating a perfect storm: scientific inconsistency + political interference + social media soundbites = total erosion of trust in anything with a stethoscope or a degree. And guess who pays the price? Not the rich. Not the anti-vax podcast influencers cashing checks from supplement sponsors. No—it’s the uninsured pregnant woman in rural America. The immunocompromised patient in a marginalized community who can’t “just go to a better hospital.” It’s public health’s most vulnerable who get torched when the fire starts at the top.

# A Canary Gasping in the Coal Mine

This new CDC recommendation isn’t just a policy misstep—it’s a demolition of credibility, brick by brick. In a post-fact, vibes-only administration that flirts with fascism and courts anti-vax sentiment like it’s prom night, we’ve decided to discard decades of progress in evidence-based medicine because it… well, because it makes certain people feel better.

If the past five years have taught us anything, it’s that trust in medicine isn’t infinite. It has to be earned—through consistency, transparency, and an uncomfortable amount of humility. What we’re watching instead is a slow-motion institutional self-immolation, where agencies burn their own reputations to keep a disinformation bonfire going for a few more political points.

And here we are. Again. Watching policy change not with peer-reviewed data or a new meta-analysis, but with a social media video and a shrug. It’s enough to make you want to scream—or at least start practicing medicine in Canada.

But in the meantime, we stay. We vaccinate where we can. We explain (again) to confused patients why something the CDC just said doesn’t make sense. We work the night shift, pull the consult, run the code—and we keep trying to patch the holes punched in the public’s faith in healthcare, one exhausted encounter at a time.

Because somebody has to.

Overall, the agency, which is responsible for monitoring infectious diseases, inspecting foods and hospitals and overseeing health insurance programs for nearly half the country, says it will decrease its workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 positions. That includes 10,000 in layoffs as well as another 10,000 workers who are taking early retirements or buyout offers that were given to nearly all federal employees by the Trump administration.

""I blame the doctors, I blame the hospital, and I blame the state of Texas,"" Ngumezi said.

...

""I feel like the law is very reckless...very dangerous,"" Ngumezi said.

Porsha Ngumezi wasn't given a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure that can be used when a miscarriage isn't complete and the patient is bleeding excessively — as Ngumezi was at the time. It's the same procedure used for many abortions, but doctors told CBS News their colleagues [hesitate to perform them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-say-texas-strict-abortion-laws-put-pregnant-women-and-physicians-at-risk-60-minutes-transcript/), fearing the state's criminal penalties.

Ngumezi believes that's what happened in his wife's situation. She eventually went into cardiac arrest and died.

""I just felt like the doctor turned his back on us. You know, 'I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to lose my license or get fined, so the best course is for me to protect myself,'"" Ngumezi said.

...

State Sen. Bryan Hughes, who authored the legislation banning most abortions in Texas, said, ""Most hospitals are getting this right, but some are not.""

In response to doctors' concerns about the [ramifications](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-law-impact-pregnant-women-60-minutes/), Hughes said, ""I hear that. And I can show you the definition of abortion in Texas and it says removal of a miscarriage is not an abortion.""

Hughes said the legislature is working on clarifying the language, but the law has yet to be amended.

[https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban](https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban)

...

But because D&amp;Cs are also used to end pregnancies, the procedure has become tangled up in state legislation that restricts abortions. In Texas, any doctor who violates the strict law risks up to 99 years in prison. Porsha’s is the fifth case ProPublica has reported in which women died after they did not receive a D&amp;C or its second-trimester equivalent, a dilation and evacuation; three of those deaths were in Texas.

...

Texas doctors told ProPublica the law has changed the way their colleagues see the procedure; some no longer consider it a first-line treatment, fearing legal repercussions or dissuaded by the extra legwork required to document the miscarriage and get hospital approval to carry out a D&amp;C. This has occurred, ProPublica found, even in cases like Porsha’s where there isn’t a fetal heartbeat or the circumstances should fall under an exception in the law. Some doctors are transferring those patients to other hospitals, which delays their care, or they’re defaulting to treatments that aren’t the medical standard.

...

“Stigma and fear are there for D&amp;Cs in a way that they are not for misoprostol,” said Dr. Alison Goulding, an OB-GYN in Houston. “Doctors assume that a D&amp;C is not standard in Texas anymore, even in cases where it should be recommended. People are afraid: They see D&amp;C as abortion and abortion as illegal.”

...

Still, the doctor didn’t mention a D&amp;C at this point, records show. Medical experts told ProPublica that this wait-and-see approach has become more common under abortion bans. Unless there is “overt information indicating that the patient is at significant risk,” hospital administrators have told physicians to simply monitor them, said Dr. Robert Carpenter, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works in several hospital systems in Houston. Methodist declined to share its miscarriage protocols with ProPublica or explain how it is guiding doctors under the abortion ban.

As Porsha waited for Hope, a radiologist completed an ultrasound and noted that she had “a pregnancy of unknown location.” The scan detected a “sac-like structure” but no fetus or cardiac activity. This report, combined with her symptoms, indicated she was miscarrying.

But the ultrasound record alone was less definitive from a legal perspective, several doctors explained to ProPublica. Since Porsha had not had a prenatal visit, there was no documentation to prove she was 11 weeks along. On paper, this “pregnancy of unknown location” diagnosis could also suggest that she was only a few weeks into a normally developing pregnancy, when cardiac activity wouldn’t be detected. Texas outlaws abortion from the moment of fertilization; a record showing there is no cardiac activity isn’t enough to give physicians cover to intervene, experts said.

Dr. Gabrielle Taper, who recently worked as an OB-GYN resident in Austin, said that she regularly witnessed delays after ultrasound reports like these. “If it’s a pregnancy of unknown location, if we do something to manage it, is that considered an abortion or not?” she said, adding that this was one of the key problems she encountered. After the abortion ban went into effect, she said, “there was much more hesitation about: When can we intervene, do we have enough evidence to say this is a miscarriage, how long are we going to wait, what will we use to feel definitive?”

...

Performing a D&amp;C, though, attracts more attention from colleagues, creating a higher barrier in a state where abortion is illegal, explained Goulding, the OB-GYN in Houston. Staff are familiar with misoprostol because it’s used for labor, and it only requires a doctor and a nurse to administer it. To do a procedure, on the other hand, a doctor would need to find an operating room, an anesthesiologist and a nursing team. “You have to convince everyone that it is legal and won’t put them at risk,” said Goulding. “Many people may be afraid and misinformed and refuse to participate — even if it’s for a miscarriage.”

...

Since Porsha died, several families in Texas have spoken publicly about similar circumstances. This May, when Ryan Hamilton’s wife was bleeding while miscarrying at 13 weeks, the first doctor they saw at Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville noted no fetal cardiac activity and ordered misoprostol, according to medical records. When they returned because the bleeding got worse, an emergency doctor on call, Kyle Demler, said he couldn’t do anything considering “the current stance” in Texas, according to Hamilton, who recorded his recollection of the conversation shortly after speaking with Demler. (Neither Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville nor Demler responded to several requests for comment.)

They drove an hour to another hospital asking for a D&amp;C to stop the bleeding, but there, too, the physician would only prescribe misoprostol, medical records indicate. Back home, Hamilton’s wife continued bleeding until he found her passed out on the bathroom floor. “You don’t think it can really happen like that,” said Hamilton. “It feels like you’re living in some sort of movie, it’s so unbelievable.”

Across Texas, physicians say they blame the law for interfering with medical care. After ProPublica reported last month on two women who died after delays in miscarriage care, 111 OB-GYNs sent a letter to Texas policymakers, saying that “the law does not allow Texas women to get the lifesaving care they need.”

Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, told ProPublica that if one person on a medical team doubts the doctor’s choice to proceed with a D&amp;C, the physician might back down. “You constantly feel like you have someone looking over your shoulder in a punitive, vigilante type of way.”

The criminal penalties are so chilling that even women with diagnoses included in the law’s exceptions are facing delays and denials. Last year, for example, legislators added an update to the ban for patients diagnosed with previable premature rupture of membranes, in which a patient’s water breaks before a fetus can survive. Doctors can still face prosecution for providing abortions in those cases, but they are offered the chance to justify themselves with what’s called an “affirmative defense,” not unlike a murder suspect arguing self defense. This modest change has not stopped some doctors from transferring those patients instead of treating them; Dr. Allison Gilbert, an OB-GYN in Dallas, said doctors send them to her from other hospitals. “They didn’t feel like other staff members would be comfortable proceeding with the abortion,” she said. “It’s frustrating that places still feel like they can’t act on some of these cases that are clearly emergencies.” Women denied treatment for ectopic pregnancies, another exception in the law, have filed federal complaints.

...

This past May, Marlena Stell, a patient with symptoms nearly identical to Porsha’s, arrived at another hospital in the system, Houston Methodist The Woodlands. According to medical records, she, too, was 11 weeks along and bleeding heavily. An ultrasound confirmed there was no fetal heartbeat and indicated the miscarriage wasn’t complete. “I assumed they would do whatever to get the bleeding to stop,” Stell said.

Instead, she bled for hours at the hospital. She wanted a D&amp;C to clear out the rest of the tissue, but the doctor gave her methergine, a medication that’s typically used after childbirth to stop bleeding but that isn’t standard care in the middle of a miscarriage, doctors told ProPublica. ""She had heavy bleeding, and she had an ultrasound that's consistent with retained products of conception."" said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed the records. ""The standard of care would be a D&amp;C.""

Stell says that instead, she was sent home and told to “let the miscarriage take its course.” She completed her miscarriage later that night, but doctors who reviewed her case, so similar to Porsha’s, said it showed how much of a gamble physicians take when they don’t follow the standard of care. “She got lucky — she could have died,” Abbott said. (Houston Methodist did not respond to a request for comment on Stell’s care.)

It hadn’t occurred to Hope that the laws governing abortion could have any effect on his wife’s miscarriage. Now it’s the only explanation that makes sense to him. “We all know pregnancies can come out beautifully or horribly,” Hope told ProPublica. “Instead of putting laws in place to make pregnancies safer, we created laws that put them back in danger.”

Signed into law in 1986, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals that receive Medicare funds to treat and stabilize anyone who presents with an emergency medical condition, regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of the type of care required.  If the hospital is not equipped to provide treatment, it must arrange a transfer.  [EMTALA requires hospitals to offer abortion care](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-22-hospitals.pdf) if needed to stabilize a pregnant person in an emergent situation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers several [resources](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)[ ](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)for providers. 

Since the Dobbs decision, there has been litigation focused on whether EMTALA’s requirements to provide stabilizing care supersede state abortion bans.

...

*Texas*

* In October 2024, the US Supreme Court denied the [Biden Administration's petition](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/court-turns-down-bidens-bid-for-intervention-in-texas-emergency-abortion-dispute/#:~:text=By%20Amy%20Howe,threatens%20their%20lives%20or%20health) to hear the Texas case, thereby leaving the lower court’s ruling intact. 

* In August 2022, a federal judge agreed with the State of Texas and temporarily blocked the HHS EMTALA guidance.

""I blame the doctors, I blame the hospital, and I blame the state of Texas,"" Ngumezi said.

...

""I feel like the law is very reckless...very dangerous,"" Ngumezi said.

Porsha Ngumezi wasn't given a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure that can be used when a miscarriage isn't complete and the patient is bleeding excessively — as Ngumezi was at the time. It's the same procedure used for many abortions, but doctors told CBS News their colleagues [hesitate to perform them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-say-texas-strict-abortion-laws-put-pregnant-women-and-physicians-at-risk-60-minutes-transcript/), fearing the state's criminal penalties.

Ngumezi believes that's what happened in his wife's situation. She eventually went into cardiac arrest and died.

""I just felt like the doctor turned his back on us. You know, 'I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to lose my license or get fined, so the best course is for me to protect myself,'"" Ngumezi said.

...

State Sen. Bryan Hughes, who authored the legislation banning most abortions in Texas, said, ""Most hospitals are getting this right, but some are not.""

In response to doctors' concerns about the [ramifications](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-law-impact-pregnant-women-60-minutes/), Hughes said, ""I hear that. And I can show you the definition of abortion in Texas and it says removal of a miscarriage is not an abortion.""

Hughes said the legislature is working on clarifying the language, but the law has yet to be amended.

...

But because D&amp;Cs are also used to end pregnancies, the procedure has become tangled up in state legislation that restricts abortions. In Texas, any doctor who violates the strict law risks up to 99 years in prison. Porsha’s is the fifth case ProPublica has reported in which women died after they did not receive a D&amp;C or its second-trimester equivalent, a dilation and evacuation; three of those deaths were in Texas.

...

Texas doctors told ProPublica the law has changed the way their colleagues see the procedure; some no longer consider it a first-line treatment, fearing legal repercussions or dissuaded by the extra legwork required to document the miscarriage and get hospital approval to carry out a D&amp;C. This has occurred, ProPublica found, even in cases like Porsha’s where there isn’t a fetal heartbeat or the circumstances should fall under an exception in the law. Some doctors are transferring those patients to other hospitals, which delays their care, or they’re defaulting to treatments that aren’t the medical standard.

...

“Stigma and fear are there for D&amp;Cs in a way that they are not for misoprostol,” said Dr. Alison Goulding, an OB-GYN in Houston. “Doctors assume that a D&amp;C is not standard in Texas anymore, even in cases where it should be recommended. People are afraid: They see D&amp;C as abortion and abortion as illegal.”

...

Still, the doctor didn’t mention a D&amp;C at this point, records show. Medical experts told ProPublica that this wait-and-see approach has become more common under abortion bans. Unless there is “overt information indicating that the patient is at significant risk,” hospital administrators have told physicians to simply monitor them, said Dr. Robert Carpenter, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works in several hospital systems in Houston. Methodist declined to share its miscarriage protocols with ProPublica or explain how it is guiding doctors under the abortion ban.

As Porsha waited for Hope, a radiologist completed an ultrasound and noted that she had “a pregnancy of unknown location.” The scan detected a “sac-like structure” but no fetus or cardiac activity. This report, combined with her symptoms, indicated she was miscarrying.

But the ultrasound record alone was less definitive from a legal perspective, several doctors explained to ProPublica. Since Porsha had not had a prenatal visit, there was no documentation to prove she was 11 weeks along. On paper, this “pregnancy of unknown location” diagnosis could also suggest that she was only a few weeks into a normally developing pregnancy, when cardiac activity wouldn’t be detected. Texas outlaws abortion from the moment of fertilization; a record showing there is no cardiac activity isn’t enough to give physicians cover to intervene, experts said.

Dr. Gabrielle Taper, who recently worked as an OB-GYN resident in Austin, said that she regularly witnessed delays after ultrasound reports like these. “If it’s a pregnancy of unknown location, if we do something to manage it, is that considered an abortion or not?” she said, adding that this was one of the key problems she encountered. After the abortion ban went into effect, she said, “there was much more hesitation about: When can we intervene, do we have enough evidence to say this is a miscarriage, how long are we going to wait, what will we use to feel definitive?”

...

Performing a D&amp;C, though, attracts more attention from colleagues, creating a higher barrier in a state where abortion is illegal, explained Goulding, the OB-GYN in Houston. Staff are familiar with misoprostol because it’s used for labor, and it only requires a doctor and a nurse to administer it. To do a procedure, on the other hand, a doctor would need to find an operating room, an anesthesiologist and a nursing team. “You have to convince everyone that it is legal and won’t put them at risk,” said Goulding. “Many people may be afraid and misinformed and refuse to participate — even if it’s for a miscarriage.”

...

Since Porsha died, several families in Texas have spoken publicly about similar circumstances. This May, when Ryan Hamilton’s wife was bleeding while miscarrying at 13 weeks, the first doctor they saw at Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville noted no fetal cardiac activity and ordered misoprostol, according to medical records. When they returned because the bleeding got worse, an emergency doctor on call, Kyle Demler, said he couldn’t do anything considering “the current stance” in Texas, according to Hamilton, who recorded his recollection of the conversation shortly after speaking with Demler. (Neither Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville nor Demler responded to several requests for comment.)

They drove an hour to another hospital asking for a D&amp;C to stop the bleeding, but there, too, the physician would only prescribe misoprostol, medical records indicate. Back home, Hamilton’s wife continued bleeding until he found her passed out on the bathroom floor. “You don’t think it can really happen like that,” said Hamilton. “It feels like you’re living in some sort of movie, it’s so unbelievable.”

Across Texas, physicians say they blame the law for interfering with medical care. After ProPublica reported last month on two women who died after delays in miscarriage care, 111 OB-GYNs sent a letter to Texas policymakers, saying that “the law does not allow Texas women to get the lifesaving care they need.”

Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, told ProPublica that if one person on a medical team doubts the doctor’s choice to proceed with a D&amp;C, the physician might back down. “You constantly feel like you have someone looking over your shoulder in a punitive, vigilante type of way.”

The criminal penalties are so chilling that even women with diagnoses included in the law’s exceptions are facing delays and denials. Last year, for example, legislators added an update to the ban for patients diagnosed with previable premature rupture of membranes, in which a patient’s water breaks before a fetus can survive. Doctors can still face prosecution for providing abortions in those cases, but they are offered the chance to justify themselves with what’s called an “affirmative defense,” not unlike a murder suspect arguing self defense. This modest change has not stopped some doctors from transferring those patients instead of treating them; Dr. Allison Gilbert, an OB-GYN in Dallas, said doctors send them to her from other hospitals. “They didn’t feel like other staff members would be comfortable proceeding with the abortion,” she said. “It’s frustrating that places still feel like they can’t act on some of these cases that are clearly emergencies.” Women denied treatment for ectopic pregnancies, another exception in the law, have filed federal complaints.

...

This past May, Marlena Stell, a patient with symptoms nearly identical to Porsha’s, arrived at another hospital in the system, Houston Methodist The Woodlands. According to medical records, she, too, was 11 weeks along and bleeding heavily. An ultrasound confirmed there was no fetal heartbeat and indicated the miscarriage wasn’t complete. “I assumed they would do whatever to get the bleeding to stop,” Stell said.

Instead, she bled for hours at the hospital. She wanted a D&amp;C to clear out the rest of the tissue, but the doctor gave her methergine, a medication that’s typically used after childbirth to stop bleeding but that isn’t standard care in the middle of a miscarriage, doctors told ProPublica. ""She had heavy bleeding, and she had an ultrasound that's consistent with retained products of conception."" said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed the records. ""The standard of care would be a D&amp;C.""

Stell says that instead, she was sent home and told to “let the miscarriage take its course.” She completed her miscarriage later that night, but doctors who reviewed her case, so similar to Porsha’s, said it showed how much of a gamble physicians take when they don’t follow the standard of care. “She got lucky — she could have died,” Abbott said. (Houston Methodist did not respond to a request for comment on Stell’s care.)

It hadn’t occurred to Hope that the laws governing abortion could have any effect on his wife’s miscarriage. Now it’s the only explanation that makes sense to him. “We all know pregnancies can come out beautifully or horribly,” Hope told ProPublica. “Instead of putting laws in place to make pregnancies safer, we created laws that put them back in danger.”

Basically, because of the protections ERISA provides it effectively renders legal remedy against an insurance company in an incredibly limited manner, including that lawsuits against ERISA-qualified health insurance plans could only be brought in federal courts without a jury/trial, basically no way to render malpractice claims, and decisions being made by a judge.

Reddit,medicine,federal loan forgiveness,wwq7l4,Federal Student Loan Debt Relief,"I’m reading the fine print on today’s EO from the Biden administration and I’m pretty sure they just partially fixed compounding interest.

Cover the borrower's unpaid monthly interest, so that unlike other existing income-driven repayment plans, no borrower's loan balance will grow as long as they make their monthly payments—even when that monthly payment is $0 because their income is low.  This could have a serious impact on compounding interest during residency/fellowship.

This is in addition to lowering the IBR from 10% to 5% of discretionary spending. (EDIT: THIS IS FOR UNDERGRADUATE LOANS ONLY).

Not to mention, though it doesn’t affect many of us, forgiveness after 10 years instead of 20 for balances under 12K and what seems to be no payments for anyone up to 225% of the federal poverty level.

Reddit,medicine,loan forgiveness program,119102i,TIL Hong Kong doctors earn A LOT,"HK medical education is a 6-year undergraduate program with an annual tuition fee (for local students) of $42,100 HKD ($5,366 USD). If loans are taken, it probably won't take long to repay. 

Medical graduates are typically 24 years old.

The doctors going into private and public healthcare sectors are divided pretty evenly, almost 50% each. 

The [government website](https://csradar.com/grade/HA/Medical-And-Health-Officer) details the MONTHLY salaries for public sector doctors:

• Resident ($65,875 - $124,835 HKD), which is about $8,396 - $15,911 USD

• Associate Consultant ($120,520 - $138,855 HKD), which is about $15,361 - $17,698 USD

• Consultant ($154,700 - $249,900 HKD), which is about $19,717 - $31,852 USD

The salaries for the doctors working in the private sector is pretty hard to find, but it is apparently widely known that it can easily be 2-3x the public sector, and there's no cap on how much a doctor can be paid.

But here is an estimate based on a forum (Please comment below if you know! I just found out about this)

• [2018 Baidu forum](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/502345734666021644.html): ""Average ANNUAL salary is between $1,500,000 - $3,000,000 HKD"" This is $191,188 - $382,377 USD
