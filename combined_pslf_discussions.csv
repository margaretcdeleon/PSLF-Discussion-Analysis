Reddit,What the Actual F - - -,Aladarye,"Warning: It’s lengthy…

I am copying/pasting my most recent correspondence exchange with MOHELA. Get a load of this mess…

I contacted them because of the forbearance they put me in (that I didn’t ask for) and the two qualifying payments I’m not getting credit for—initially just March because they claimed I was in already the forbearance when my payment was AUTO DRAFTED from my account, and then retroactive February for the supposed same reason (but they didn’t have any problems taking my automatic draft payments that SHOULDN’T have processed if I was actually under forbearance at the time). 

Here is the copy/paste of the message I sent them:

Original message:

Hello.

Back in March, AFTER making my monthly payment, I was placed in a forbearance (presumably because of the SAVE business, except that I was never on SAVE and there was some runaround hangup on recertifying my income that apparently didn’t need to happen). After two months of back and forth and runaround with MOHELA, I finally got the forbearance lifted and payments resumed.

Prior to this forbearance mess, my March payment was showing as qualifying, but needing employment certification on the StudentAid.gov website. I periodically check my accounts, and I have noticed that it is now showing as ineligible, citing that I was in forbearance on my due date. As I have always had automatic drafts done for my payments, if I was in forbearance on that date, my payment would not have drafted. Is there any way I can get this payment back to qualifying, as it should have been? (Especially since I was never in SAVE and should not have been placed in that forbearance, to begin with). I already lost the months of April and May of this year to be able to make payments because it took that long and going through a LOT of different departments with MOHELA to get it fixed to where I was no longer on the forbearance. Since that mess already set me behind by two months (when it should not have), I don’t want to lose March on top of it, as I made that payment (auto-drafted and unaware of the road MOHELA was about to send me down). It feels like folks are being punished every step of the way while trying to follow the rules of this program (if you don’t believe me, go check out the subreddit PSLF…it’s very depressing).

Also, I noticed that my July payment, which came out on the 20th (two and a half weeks ago) is not yet showing up on my StudentAid.gov account. Is this also an oversight and the info has not been shared with them, yet? I know it took a while for my June payment to show up on their website, but I don’t recall it taking this long.

Thanks for any insight you can give!

Reddit,Question Regarding Buyback Strategy,Addicted2Parmesan,"Hi all. In a couple days I'll be making my 111th qualifying payment, with 9 months of payments from the SAVE forbearance that I am eligible to buy back. My current plan is to apply for buy back while continuing to make payments and hypothetically seeing what happens first (either get to the 120, or buy back getting approved).

I have a strategy question though. My payment right now under ICR is close to $700/month, whereas my REPAYE payment would likely be several hundred less (assuming that's how the continue to calculate buy back). Meaning the difference between 9 months of payments at my current rate versus what would be the buyback total could be thousands of dollars different.

Question: If I keep making payments, but do not certify them, would I potentially be able to get my 9 months of buy back on the discounted REPAYE calculation and then get a refund on whatever uncertified payments I may have made? Or does the certifying of those months not factor in when they finally get around to my buyback application?

Reddit,My roller coaster is coming to an end…,Snoo_68013,"Just putting out some data points for anyone this might help as I close this chapter.

I reached 120 months of employment in Oct 2024 and was at 116 QPs. I applied for buy back for SAVE months (and/or 1 month from 2016) in October 2024 and again in December 2024.

With no news of the buyback, I applied to move to IBR in January. To date, I have done 2 IBR applications (one wet sig upload to Mohela and one with FSA) and both times I have been unsuccessful in getting on the new repayment plan. 

I fought and fought with Mohela. Escalated as far as I could before reaching out to their CEO and was put in contact with their internal Ombudsman team. The ombudsman team was able to get some errors on my account corrected (June 2024 I had made a payment before the pause that they did not acknowledge, February 2025 was just flat missing from FSA, getting NSLDS updated) but unfortunately they could not get me in IBR and they had nothing else to offer other than to wait…..acknowledging that 8 months of waiting was unusual and that they did not know why I was stuck, their own internal work arounds weren’t helping.

As frustrated as it was - and still is TBH - all of the back and forth with my IBR apps kept me in a reoccurring processing forbearance that fortunately granted me green banners for 6 of 7 loans in June 2025. I had 1 loan that for no apparent reason stayed at 119 with June 2025 not counting as eligible. 

I fought this with the ombudsman team and they said there was nothing they could do and blamed FSA and visa versa.

I was put back into processing forbearance for this last loan after sending a strong worded email to Mohela CEO and Ombudsman team…and crossed my fingers the green banners I had would actually work out as I had been told only 2 months of processing forbearance would be PSLF eligible.

To my amazement I received full forgiveness this month for 6 of my seven loans and was 200K lighter.

I waited for July to pass and noted an NSLDS update reflecting the 7th loan was finally at 120. I submitted a ECF and today got green banners for my last and final loan.

I never did get on IBR or have a buy back processed, but they also didn’t get 1 more cent out of me following SAVE injunction….which serves them right after all the errors, chaos, flat out incorrect information and BS they fed me for YEARS.

This has been the most incompetent system I have ever witnessed or could have imagined. There is no such thing as a hyperbole when speaking to the insanity of this governmental organization and its contractors.

Reddit,Help with confusing PSLF/IBR situation,CherryImpressive2552,"Much of the advice I've seen is for people closer to forgiveness than me, so I was hoping to get a few points of confusion cleared up. I have 14 qualifying payments made and 12 months (and counting) in SAVE forbearance that I plan to buy-back eventually. Assuming I eventually end up on IBR, will this buyback be calculated based on my AGI at the time of the forbearance, or my AGI at the time of the buyback request? 

For IBR payments, there is a cap where your payment will never exceed the 10-year standard repayment amount. Does this cap still exist after the recent changes? Also, is that 10-years from the date I enter the IBR plan, or do they use the disbursement date? 

I ask because, for the moment at least, I plan on staying in SAVE forbearance as long as possible and buying back later, but if I allow my interest to accumulate I'm worried that will result in a higher IBR payment down the road.

I currently have a toddler at home and would like to pursue staying at home with him for the next couple of years.

Now, if I can't buy back my earlier periods, and they aren't counting June/July 2024 for Buyback, then I need to work through the end of the year.

* Are June/July really not counting for buyback eligibility for the Mohela servicer switch?

Reddit,Please help me understand how Trump's Bill impacts medical loans.,Trippanzee,"Hi all,

I’m trying to plan my financial future, and the federal government seems determined to make that as stressful as possible. I’d really appreciate help understanding how the proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill” might impact student loans for current medical students.

For context, I’m a rising M2.

From what I understand, all loans **disbursed after July 1, 2026** would fall under the new rules — including a **$150,000 borrowing cap** and the **loss of PSLF eligibility**. Even if the loan was authorized or the promissory note signed earlier, what matters is the **disbursement date**. That would mean my **M3 and M4 loans would be subject to the new restrictions**.

However, I came across the “application of prior limits” clause, which states:

&gt;

This makes me unsure:

* **Does this mean current students like me will be exempt from the new borrowing limits entirely?**
* Or should I still try to take out as much in federal loans as possible before July 1, 2026, to preserve PSLF eligibility?

Any clarification would be greatly appreciated as I try to make informed borrowing decisions",1750439264.0,22,medicalschool,"Please help me understand how Trump's Bill impacts medical loans. Hi all,

Reddit,Senate HELP Committee Loan Proposals Will Harm Med School Students- Write Your Senators,FlexyZebra,"[From the CRFB](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-help-committee-proposes-355-billion-offsets)\- Jun. 11, 2025, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee released its part of the Senate reconciliation package, which estimates a savings of roughly **$355 billion** between fiscal year (FY) 2025 and 2034. These savings come from eliminating and limiting loans for graduate-level studies such as medical school.

&gt;They “estimate an additional $50 billion of savings from eliminating graduate PLUS loans and limiting borrowing in other loans. Specifically, the package limits graduate borrowing to $20,500 annually and $100,000 total for master’s students and $50,000 annually and $200,000 total for professional students (such as lawyers, doctors, or dentists). This differs from the House, which had $150,000 aggregate caps for professional students, and annual limits in the House bill were set at the program level.

&gt;The Senate also sets an aggregate cap on the amounts parents can borrow to $20,000 per year and $65,000 lifetime *per child,* whereas the House plan caps aggregate borrowing to $50,000 for all children of the parent. The Senate also leaves loan limits for undergraduates untouched (whereas the House allows for borrowing based on the typical cost of a given program of study) and does not include the House requirement that students borrow before parents. The Senate also retains Subsidized Stafford loans, which are repealed in the House for a savings of $20 billion.”

The median cost of attending medical school per the AAMC (public + living expenses) is $250,000–$300,000+. The proposed $200,000 cap leaves many students tens of thousands short. Eliminating Grad PLUS loans pushes students toward riskier private debt and those loans do not qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or income-driven repayment. It disproportionately harms first-generation students, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and students without family financial support.

Workforce shortages will worsen if students can’t afford to attend. The AAMC projects a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. Reducing access to medical education exacerbates healthcare gaps, especially in rural and underserved areas.

Their rationale for imposing borrowing caps is based on concerns that some graduate programs lead to degrees with limited earning potential, making it difficult for students to repay their loans. They also want to pressure institutions to control tuition inflation. While these are good intentions, the proposals will harm med school students and worsen the physician shortfall if modifications and carveouts aren't made.

Write your Congress members to ask for: 1. Exemptions or increased borrowing caps for medical, dental, and other high-cost programs. 2. Creation of a targeted federal supplemental loan for healthcare shortage fields. 3. Strengthening loan forgiveness programs like PSLF for graduates who serve in rural or underserved areas.

Subject: Protect Access to Federal Loans for Medical Students

Dear \[Senator/Representative LAST NAME\],

I’m writing to urge you to protect access to federal student loans for medical students like myself. While I recognize the importance of addressing the national debt, the proposal to eliminate Grad PLUS loans and cap borrowing at $200,000 for professional students will prevent many future doctors, dentists, and other critical professionals from completing their education.

The average cost of attending medical school is well over $250,000, leaving students to cover tens of thousands in gaps with private loans that don’t offer the same protections as federal programs. This proposal disproportionately harms students from low-income families, underrepresented backgrounds, and rural areas.

The U.S. is already facing significant physician shortages. Restricting access to medical education will only deepen the crisis in underserved communities.

Please consider supporting:

* Exemptions or increased borrowing caps for medical, dental, and other high-cost programs.
* Creation of a targeted federal supplemental loan for healthcare shortage fields.
* Strengthening loan forgiveness programs like PSLF for graduates who serve in rural or underserved areas.

Thank you for your leadership and consideration on this issue.

Sincerely,

starting residency this summer, next week is my last week as a student. originally planning to do IM -&gt; primary care, with the intention of pursuing a PSLF career pathway. 

I am concerned about the fidelity of PSLF. i understand that I signed a promissory note for my federal loans guaranteeing PSLF.

I fear that the government will approach the DOE similarly to other agencies by cutting the workforce down to a point that it will take years after the current administration's rule to recoup workforce and institutional knowledge to catch up on PSLF loan forgiveness applications.

With this in mind, my question is, do I make IDR minimums in residency in order to preserve some quality of life *or* should I maximize my loan payment and cut out as much discretionary spending with the intention of paying down my loans quicker?

Reddit,Help Me Fight Against the End of IDR,zammitti,"Hello everyone, I have written a bit of an opinion-piece that I hope to turn into a petition for current medical students and residents to voice our deep dissatisfaction with the current administration's encroachment on IDR and Federal Loans. Looking for feedback before circulating as a petition and contacting my state's attorney general. I know this is a small move, but I can't sit by and do nothing. Thanks:

The federal student loan program was created in 1965 to tackle the high cost of secondary and graduate education in the United States. In 1992, Congress approved **Income Contingent Repayment (ICR)** (20 USC 1087e), which allowed for borrowers to have their student loan payments determined by their income – no more than 20% of discretionary income – and offered loan forgiveness after 25 years of monthly payments. This is applicable to Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct Consolidation Loans, and Direct PLUS loans (taken out by professional and graduate students). At that time, the median annual cost for 4-year tuition and fees for medical school was US$6,740 and US$18,365, respectively^(1).

 In 2009, **Income Based Repayment (IBR)** became available and set monthly payments at 15% of discretionary income, defined as (Borrower’s Gross Income) – (150% of the poverty guidance relevant for the borrower) and retained loan forgiveness after 25 years of repayment. **IBR2** became law in 2010, although it was not available until 2014, through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. This law reduced the monthly payment to 10% of discretionary income and loan forgiveness after 20 years of payments. **Pay As You Earn (PAYE)** became available in 2012, and closely mirrored IBR2 with some additional stipulations and benefits. A similar plan, **Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)**, was introduced in 2015 with some additional benefits on top of PAYE. The **Save on Valuable Education (SAVE)** plan was rolled out in August, 2023. It reduced the monthly payment to 5% of discretionary income beginning in July, 2024, and included repayment timelines of 20 and 25 years for undergraduate and graduate borrowers, respectively. There are additional benefits in SAVE for low income earners and those with large families with the increased income exemption to 225%. 

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)** was introduced by the Bush administration in 2007. Although the first 10 years of the program’s rollout was fraught with issues that limited its effectiveness, fixes such as the Employer Certification Form have made this an essential program for future physicians. PSLF allows those who work full-time in public service (U.S.-based government organizations at any level, 501(c)(3) organizations, and other not-for-profit organizations) to make a total of 120 qualifying, nonconsecutive payments under an income driven repayment plan (SAVE, PAYE, IBR, ICR). 

The following is a direct line from the Master Promissory Note for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, as well as Direct PLUS Loans:

·      **Public Service Loan Forgiveness**

·      A Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is also available. Under this program, we will forgive the remaining balance due on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 payments (after October 1, 2007) on those loans under certain repayment plans while you are employed full-time by a qualifying employer. The required 120 payments do not have to be consecutive. Qualifying repayment plans include the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, the ICR Plan, and the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period.

·      **Note:** Although the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period is a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF, to receive any loan forgiveness under this program you must enter the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, and make the majority of the 120 payments under one of those plans.

In spring 2024, a federal court issued an injunction from fully implementing the SAVE plan. In July 2024, the 8^(th) circuit court of appeals blocked the SAVE plan in its entirety, placing those already in the program in interest-free forbearance. On February 18^(th), 2025, this same court upheld the injunction for the SAVE plan. The Trump administration has also blocked processing of PAYE and ICR plans as well. **At this time, the Department of Education has removed online applications to apply for federal Direct consolidation loans and income based repayment plans and are forced to pay the standardized repayment plan cost.** This is in direct conflict with the Master Promissory Note for each loan, which is signed each time a loan is taken out, and specifically states that our loans are eligible for PSLF, which requires that most payments must be completed under income driven repayment plans (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR, or ICR). 

I will use myself as an example of the seriousness of this issue. I am a rising intern, starting work in July. Interns and residents are expected to work up to 80 hours per week. Using an $80,000 per year salary for a resident (which is quite conservative) and $310,000 in unsubsidized federal loans (which were accrued over 4 years at a state school and included cost-of-living loans), my monthly payment on SAVE would be $384/month; on IBR would be $478/month; and on standard repayment plan would be $3,649/month. Under the current tax code, my take home salary would be $4,748/month in Massachusetts. These numbers will change with salary as residents move to become an attending but, under income drive repayment plans, that monthly payment will never exceed the monthly standard repayment plan. After 120 nonconsecutive payments on an income drive repayment plan, the remainder of the balance of my loans would be forgiven tax-free. This example underlines how crucial these income driven repayment plans are for residents in particular. While Massachusetts is a high cost of living state, the public and private medical school total cost of attendance in 2024 across the country was $60,000/year for in-state students and $90,000/year for private institutions, including tuition, fees, and living expenses. Thus, $310,000 in loans, including interest accrued during school, is typical. Furthermore, the salaries for residents in lower-cost of living states are generally lower as well. 

In 2024, the average annual cost of public and private medical school tuition and fees were US$53,485 and US$67,950, respectively^(3). This represents a 694.2% increase in public school costs and 270.5% increase in private school costs, while inflation over the same period is about 124% based on Consumer Price Index, using the Federal Reserve Bank inflation calculator. In 1992, physician average income was $177,400^(4). In 2024, that number was $363,000, although there has always been a wide range of salaries depending on specialty and location across the country^(5). This represents a 104.7% increase between those two timepoints. 

The 2024 physician compensation report projects a shortage of physicians in 2034 that could be as high as 124,000, including 17,800-48,000 deficit in primary care, 16,800 medical specialists, and 13,900 surgeons. The high cost of medical education is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to increasing the number of physicians. In addition, the increasing cuts to public insurance (Medicaid and Medicare) and increasing number of insurance claim denials by private insurers will continue to cut into physician salaries, particularly those in primary care. How do we expect to adequately treat an increasingly older and more complex population when we disincentivize future physicians from following this career path? How are young physicians going to be expected to pay for this massive and unexpected increase repayment burden on low salaries for 80 hours of work per week? How do we expect to support public healthcare institutions and public service if there is no more incentive as young physicians will ultimately pursue private medicine just to pay their loans?

Looking for feedback before circulating as a petition and contacting my state's attorney general. I know this is a small move, but I can't sit by and do nothing. Thanks:

The federal student loan program was created in 1965 to tackle the high cost of secondary and graduate education in the United States. In 1992, Congress approved **Income Contingent Repayment (ICR)** (20 USC 1087e), which allowed for borrowers to have their student loan payments determined by their income – no more than 20% of discretionary income – and offered loan forgiveness after 25 years of monthly payments. This is applicable to Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct Consolidation Loans, and Direct PLUS loans (taken out by professional and graduate students). At that time, the median annual cost for 4-year tuition and fees for medical school was US$6,740 and US$18,365, respectively^(1).

 In 2009, **Income Based Repayment (IBR)** became available and set monthly payments at 15% of discretionary income, defined as (Borrower’s Gross Income) – (150% of the poverty guidance relevant for the borrower) and retained loan forgiveness after 25 years of repayment. **IBR2** became law in 2010, although it was not available until 2014, through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. This law reduced the monthly payment to 10% of discretionary income and loan forgiveness after 20 years of payments. **Pay As You Earn (PAYE)** became available in 2012, and closely mirrored IBR2 with some additional stipulations and benefits. A similar plan, **Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)**, was introduced in 2015 with some additional benefits on top of PAYE. The **Save on Valuable Education (SAVE)** plan was rolled out in August, 2023. It reduced the monthly payment to 5% of discretionary income beginning in July, 2024, and included repayment timelines of 20 and 25 years for undergraduate and graduate borrowers, respectively. There are additional benefits in SAVE for low income earners and those with large families with the increased income exemption to 225%. 

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)** was introduced by the Bush administration in 2007. Although the first 10 years of the program’s rollout was fraught with issues that limited its effectiveness, fixes such as the Employer Certification Form have made this an essential program for future physicians. PSLF allows those who work full-time in public service (U.S.-based government organizations at any level, 501(c)(3) organizations, and other not-for-profit organizations) to make a total of 120 qualifying, nonconsecutive payments under an income driven repayment plan (SAVE, PAYE, IBR, ICR). 

The following is a direct line from the Master Promissory Note for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, as well as Direct PLUS Loans:

- Been married for the last few years
- Husband makes a little over 100K and we have been filing taxes jointly and he is claiming me as a dependent (or something like that? or maybe not and we are just filing with his income?)

Should we plan to do anything differently in the years ahead like filing separately in order to minimize my loan repayment? Is that a thing? Or is it still better to just keep doing what we are doing?

I’m a pharmacist but hoping you can use my letter as a template. Write your representatives especially the republicans.


Good morning Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern about the future of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, particularly for those of us who are already years into our service commitments. My wife and I are both pharmacists at ——— and ———-outside of ———. We entered healthcare with a commitment to serving others, and we care deeply about our patients.

PSLF and the nonprofit status of hospitals have been essential in enabling us to care for Pennsylvania’s population. However, recent discussions about eliminating PSLF or revoking hospitals’ nonprofit status put not only our financial stability at risk but also the future of healthcare access in Pennsylvania. If nonprofit hospitals lose their status, many healthcare workers—including my wife and me—could be disqualified from PSLF, making it significantly harder for professionals to remain in these critical roles.

Pennsylvania, particularly rural areas, is already facing severe shortages of nurses, pharmacists, and doctors. If PSLF or nonprofit hospital status is weakened or eliminated, we risk a drastic decline in healthcare professionals, further limiting access to care for many Pennsylvanians.

When we took out our loans, we entered into an agreement with the government, committing to years of hard work and service—even through the worst pandemic in a century. We simply ask for the chance to fulfill our commitment under the PSLF program. Without it, building a family and maintaining a stable future will become significantly more difficult for us and many others in similar positions.

As you consider policies affecting PSLF and nonprofit hospitals, I urge you to think of the long-term impact on rural Pennsylvania’s healthcare system and the patients who rely on it. Thank you for your time and consideration

Reddit,PSLF isn’t going anywhere for current med Students and borrowers—here’s why you don’t need to panic,Stock_Doc_,"Yes, Trump winning the election is bad news for a bunch of reasons. But for those freaking out about PSLF and whether it’s still a solid plan for debt relief, let’s cool down on spreading panic. **If you’re a current med student who’s taken out PSLF loans, or you’re a resident/attending already making payments, you’re in a safe spot for PSLF.** Here’s why:

Historically, legislative changes to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, have included provisions to ""grandfather"" existing borrowers. This means that **individuals who have already begun making PSLF-eligible payments would continue to benefit under the original terms, even if new legislation alters or ends the program for future borrowers.** For instance, previous proposals to modify or eliminate PSLF have often specified that current participants would not be affected. This approach of grandfathering isn’t unique to student loans—it's a common practice across various federal programs and policies. For example, in retirement and tax laws, when Congress has enacted changes that restrict or modify certain benefits, they have allowed people already participating to continue under the old rules. A notable example is changes to Roth IRA conversions; when tax rules were tightened, individuals who had already contributed under previous guidelines were allowed to maintain their benefits. Similarly, with Social Security benefits, when retirement age requirements have shifted, individuals close to retirement were grandfathered in to prevent disrupting their retirement plans.

Regarding Trump specifically and his past attempt at eliminating PSLF - During his last presidency, Trump proposed eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Notably, his fiscal year 2021 budget suggested ending PSLF for new borrowers as of July 1, 2020, effectively ""grandfathering"" in existing borrowers who had already taken out PSLF-eligible loans. This approach aimed to prevent disruptions for current participants while discontinuing the program for future borrowers. **In summary, although he did attempt to remove PSLF his proposed plan would have grandfathered in all of us – students who already had taken out PSLF-eligible loans. Furthermore, the plan allowed students grandfathered in to still take out more PSLF-eligible loans.** 

The one fair concerning change to PSLF, rather than eliminating it outright, could involve increasing the administrative burden—making the process more complex or strict for future borrowers. This might mean more paperwork, stricter documentation requirements, or tighter eligibility checks, which would make accessing forgiveness more cumbersome but not impossible. We’ve seen this happen with PSLF already; in the past, the program had high rejection rates due to complex requirements and confusion around eligible payments. However, recent efforts have shown that these issues can be addressed. For example, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and various student loan counseling services have developed resources to help borrowers navigate PSLF, even with its intricate rules. So, while an increase in administrative hurdles could make the process more challenging, it wouldn’t eliminate PSLF’s benefits. With careful planning and staying on top of your paperwork, your PSLF will be processed and any extra payments you made due to delays in processing will be refunded eventually. 

Bottom Line: **Stay informed and don’t fear monger**, current med students with PSLF-eligible loans and those who have started making payments should feel reassured that they are safe. 

\*\*\*If anything I mentioned is wrong please do let me know but as a student who is heavily depending on PSLF for loan forgiveness I have dedicated immense time to following this issue for many years. ",1730892957.0,165,medicalschool,"PSLF isn’t going anywhere for current med Students and borrowers—here’s why you don’t need to panic Yes, Trump winning the election is bad news for a bunch of reasons.

Regarding Trump specifically and his past attempt at eliminating PSLF - During his last presidency, Trump proposed eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Notably, his fiscal year 2021 budget suggested ending PSLF for new borrowers as of July 1, 2020, effectively ""grandfathering"" in existing borrowers who had already taken out PSLF-eligible loans. This approach aimed to prevent disruptions for current participants while discontinuing the program for future borrowers. **In summary, although he did attempt to remove PSLF his proposed plan would have grandfathered in all of us – students who already had taken out PSLF-eligible loans. Furthermore, the plan allowed students grandfathered in to still take out more PSLF-eligible loans.** 

The one fair concerning change to PSLF, rather than eliminating it outright, could involve increasing the administrative burden—making the process more complex or strict for future borrowers. This might mean more paperwork, stricter documentation requirements, or tighter eligibility checks, which would make accessing forgiveness more cumbersome but not impossible. We’ve seen this happen with PSLF already; in the past, the program had high rejection rates due to complex requirements and confusion around eligible payments. However, recent efforts have shown that these issues can be addressed. For example, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and various student loan counseling services have developed resources to help borrowers navigate PSLF, even with its intricate rules. So, while an increase in administrative hurdles could make the process more challenging, it wouldn’t eliminate PSLF’s benefits. With careful planning and staying on top of your paperwork, your PSLF will be processed and any extra payments you made due to delays in processing will be refunded eventually. 

Bottom Line: **Stay informed and don’t fear monger**, current med students with PSLF-eligible loans and those who have started making payments should feel reassured that they are safe. 

\*\*\*If anything I mentioned is wrong please do let me know but as a student who is heavily depending on PSLF for loan forgiveness I have dedicated immense time to following this issue for many years. ",0.09781413912366294,0.43473928628690534,neutral

Reddit,Need Advice for Dealing with Student Loan Anxiety,eternalangst,"I am only an MS1, but I am currently expected to graduate medical school with well over 300,000 dollars in medical school debt. I can not get over the mental hurdle of the crushing weight of that number. I know that PSLF exists, and SAVE plans and other methods of repayment, but it all seems so unattainable when I am so far from that being a reality. Logically, when I stop and truly think I know I can pay it back eventually (or at least I know other people have done it), but whenever I think about my loans, logic goes out the window. I have always had extreme money anxiety, and every time I think about my student loans it almost always ends in a panic attack. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How do you deal with the onslaught of anxiety from overwhelmingly large student loans? So many people have told me to just ""ignore it"" but I simply can't do that, even though I most definitely wish I could. Any advice or tips that have worked for you would be appreciated, I'm willing to try most anything.",1725555705.0,2,medicalschool,"Need Advice for Dealing with Student Loan Anxiety I am only an MS1, but I am currently expected to graduate medical school with well over 300,000 dollars in medical school debt.

Reddit,Tuition service exchange/loan repayment programs,Gorilla_Pluto,"Hello, I am an MS-0 and I have always had a strong interest in primary care. I applied to a program from my medical school, in which the program would pay for my tuition for all four years as well as a living stipend. In exchange, immediately after residency, I would have to work full time for four years in my state in either primary care (45 hours a week) or emergency medicine (36 hours a week), which I am totally fine with doing. I would not have to pull out any loans for medical school, and it would remove the stress of loan repayments during residency. 

Sounds like a pretty good deal that I can't turn away, and probably will not turn away. My only hesitancies surround a few things that I am up in the air about. One drawback is that I wouldn't be allowed to do any fellowships after residency if I wanted to. The other drawback is that, although right now I am 100% set on primary care and cannot see myself doing anything else, what if that changes four years from now?

Would you recommend taking this offer right now? Or should I wait till later for other opportunities that aren't necessarily guaranteed, like PSLF or NHSC?",1713579434.0,3,medicalschool,"Tuition service exchange/loan repayment programs Hello, I am an MS-0 and I have always had a strong interest in primary care.
